            More than ten million foreclosures have piled up nationwide since
            the beginning of the mortgage crisis (<a
              href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/invasive-tactic-in-foreclosures-draws-scrutiny/?_r=1"
              >Silver-Greenberg</a
            >), forcing untold millions of people out of their homes. Egregious
            but all-too-common corporate practices contributed to the disaster:
            robo-signed or plainly fraudulent paperwork; borrowers with prime
            credit scores receiving subprime loans based on race. A series of
            government “settlements” benefitted too-big-to-fail banks far more
            than struggling homeowners.  As people lost jobs and struggled to
            stay in their homes, multiple forms of debt began to intersect,
            leaving many to choose between mortgage payments and medical bills,
            groceries, or student loan installments.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few hundred homes out of millions have been saved with direct
            action. Groups like Occupy Oakland Foreclosure Defense have focused
            their efforts on individual homeowners with tragic stories like that
            of
            <a
              href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/07/02/1220524/-We-Can-No-Longer-DefendJodie-She-Has-Passed-The-Evil-That-Banks-Do-However"
              >Jodie Randolph in Alameda, CA,</a
            >
            who was being forced to choose between chemotherapy and a roof over
            her head. Others have pursued lawsuits with lackluster results.
            Government programs and monies from “settlements” with the big banks
            have only reached a small percentage of those affected, and even
            then it is often too little, too late. In other words, we’ve barely
            made a dent. We need a more radical solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter Richmond, California, a small city of roughly a hundred
            thousand people (39% Latino, 31% white, 26% African American.)
            Richmond has been hit particularly hard by the foreclosure crisis
            and recently decided to do something about it. In late July of 2013,
            the city approached banks and other holders of 624 underwater
            properties, offering to buy the mortgages at fair market value in
            order to refinance them and give residents substantial principal
            reductions (see Appendix II). Not a single mortgage holder
            responded. Richmond then decided to explore the option of seizing
            the mortgages through eminent domain.
          </p>
          <p>The 1% has other ideas.</p>
          <p>
            In response to the whisper of eminent domain, Wells Fargo and
            Deutsche Bank filed a lawsuit<sup
              ><a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">1</a></sup
            >
            demanding an injunction forbidding Richmond from continuing this
            process; analysts predicted that banks would never write a mortgage
            in Richmond again, and Wall Street managed to blackball the city to
            such an extent that no one was willing to buy a standard, vanilla
            municipal bond offering they floated in August, 2013. Ratings
            agencies also threatened to downgrade Richmond’s A- credit rating.
          </p>
          <p>
            No one seems to bat an eye
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelo_v._City_of_New_London"
              >when eminent domain is used to seize land in the name of
              “economic development,”</a
            >
            but where it’s being used to directly improve the economic
            well-being of homeowners and the city at large Wall Street unleashes
            its wrath.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swayed by the intense pressure, Richmond’s city council now seems
            divided on how to proceed – but Richmond’s citizens seem more
            united. At a September 2013 meeting, one councilmember opposed to
            the plan asked the packed crowd, “Do you really want a tiny city
            like Richmond to take on Wall Street?” “<i>YES!”</i> was the
            uproarious response. While the banks’ initial lawsuit was dismissed
            (but can still be re-filed), there is no doubt that Wall Street and
            the Obama administration will continue to pressure Richmond to drop
            the plan. (The
            <a href="http://www.fhfa.gov/">Federal Housing Finance Agency</a>
            has all but threatened to file suit itself).
          </p>
          <p>
            Why is Wall Street so frightened? After all, investors would be paid
            fair market value for the mortgages they are holding. Indeed,
            <a
              href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/current_issues/ci19-5.html"
              >the original version of the plan</a
            >, written by Professor Richard Hockett of Cornell University, posed
            it not as radical but as a “market corrective.” Hockett designed the
            plan as a win for creditors as well as homeowners, a method to bring
            the market back in a way that returns steady, predictable profits to
            investors and helps communities fund their operations by
            recuperating the local tax base. So again, if the plan’s original
            architect had such conservative intentions (at least to radical
            ears), why the hullabaloo? And why might those of us interested in
            more radical approaches to systemic debt support this particular
            plan? Here are a few thoughts:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In most cases banks don’t actually own these mortgages. Mortgages
              were and continue to be repackaged into securities by banks and
              then sold in tranches to investors across the world. What banks do
              is service these mortgages. They get paid fees for collecting
              mortgage payments; they get paid fees for dealing with homeowners
              questions and refinance requests; if a home goes into foreclosure,
              they get paid to handle all the foreclosure proceedings and a fee
              to handle an eviction if necessary. Were the Richmond plan to go
              through, many banks would no longer act as servicers and would
              thus lose that revenue stream.
            </li>
            <li>
              In some cases, investor holdings of mortgage securities may be on
              their books at still-inflated rates rather than at current market
              value. In other words, the mortgage-backed securities may be
              priced based on the original principal amount and current revenue
              stream (optimistically forecasting the probability of default as
              small) rather than on what someone would pay for the security at
              the present time. Were the Richmond plan to go through, these
              holdings would be “marked to market” and pension funds, hedge
              funds and other entities which hold these securities would find
              themselves with less on their books than they had previously been
              able to claim.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Federal government has so far forbidden Fannie Mae and Freddie
              Mac from allowing principal reductions. This has set a national
              precedent putting principal reductions outside the realm of
              possibility. If Richmond were to set a new precedent, no one knows
              what effect it might have on the mortgage securities market.
              Financial markets, of course, are a confidence scheme, based as
              much (if not more) on trust, perception and affect than on
              quantitative modeling or microeconomic theorems. If it is shown
              that a single municipality can take on Wall Street successfully
              and possibly spread its ideas across the country, the mortgage
              securities market could collapse.
            </li>
            <li>
              Risk is always calculated into any investment scheme and becomes a
              major factor in price. The concept of seizing mortgages, something
              previously unheard of, introduces risk of an entirely new nature
              and might radically change the calculus of investing in mortgage
              securities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, the mortgage market has been the exclusive province of
              bankers, and there is no way they will cede power over this
              lucrative business to the public without a fight.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            These are just five reasons why Wall Street might be scared, though
            there are likely many more we haven’t thought of. Generally, it’s a
            fair bet that you’re onto something when both big banks and big
            government want to sue you. We sense that there may be more profound
            reasons for their fear—ways in which the ongoing mortgage crisis
            makes vulnerable the very infrastructures of capitalism. For
            instance, hundreds of thousands of mortgages have broken chains of
            title (as just one example, we cite
            <a
              href="http://www.salon.com/2013/08/12/your_mortgage_documents_are_fake/"
              ><i>Your Mortgage Documents Are Fake</i></a
            >), which means <b><i>no one knows who, if anyone, owns them</i></b
            >. Despite pathetic “settlements” trying to wish this reality away,
            these broken chains throw the nature of private property across the
            country into question in an unprecedented way. If Richmond and other
            municipalities are emboldened by a win with eminent domain, more
            radical agendas then seem increasingly possible—simply taking
            mortgages that no one can prove ownership of and using the capital
            to start a public bank, or redistributing those homes to their
            owners with clear title and no mortgage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Richmond situation presents ethical quandaries for the radical
            imagination. In order to come this far, and to continue, Richmond
            has relied on the pro bono services of a for-profit firm,
            <a href="http://mortgageresolution.com/"
              >Mortgage Resolution Partners</a
            >
            (MRP). They are currently covering all of Richmond’s legal fees,
            offering technical assistance and, theoretically, providing access
            to the mortgage securities markets. Should mortgages ultimately be
            taken by eminent domain and restructured, MRP stands to gain $4,500
            per mortgage (a relative pittance, considering all the resources
            they have and will have expended). For MRP, Richmond is clearly a
            loss leader; to make a profit, they would almost certainly have to
            take this program statewide or nationwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this time we take no position on MRP’s role other than to note
            that without its existence and its promise to cover costs, Richmond
            would never have embarked on this battle. We do observe that much of
            MRP’s role could be played by a local or state public bank, a
            non-profit institution that has as an existence proof the
            <a href="http://banknd.nd.gov/">Public Bank of North Dakota</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Richmond’s next step will be to create a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_powers_authority"
              >Joint Powers Authority</a
            >, which will allow Richmond to work with other willing
            municipalities in California on this project. The wider the
            participation, the less the risk to any single municipality, and the
            more Wall Street will tremble. And yet, this fight has just begun.
            If Richmond’s Mayor decides she has no choice but to go the eminent
            domain route, she will need a fifth, supermajority-giving vote from
            her fellow councilmembers, as necessitated by California law. Even

              >complicated legal issues</a
            >
            that may affect the strategy in court. (For instance, Richmond may
            have the right to seize things within its borders, but does a
            mortgage—held by a set of investors around the globe— actually exist
            “within” Richmond? Does it matter?) Finally, even clearing the legal
            hurdles, this particular iteration of the eminent domain plan only
            helps a certain subset of debt-owners: those whose homes are
            underwater, but who are not yet in foreclosure. In other words, this
            is not yet the radical, systemic solution we envision and toward
            which we will work tirelessly. It is, however, people taking power
            back from Wall Street in imaginative ways, and may serve as a kind
            of radical calisthenics, getting us in shape for the bigger fights
            to come.

            <b>Appendix I</b>: If you think this is a good idea, here’s what you
            can do to help:<br />
            1) Spread the word! You never know who might pick up on the idea and
            try to implement it.
          </p>
          <p>
            2) If you live in California, try getting your city or town to
            consider the idea and join the Joint Powers Authority (<a
              href="http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/index.aspx?NID=98%22%3e"
              >Patrick Lynch, Director of Richmond’s Housing and Community
              Development Division</a
            >). Or attempt to get your city council to issue a letter in support
            of Richmond’s efforts to fight foreclosures in this novel fashion.
          </p>
          <p>
            3) If you are not in California, check to see if your state allows
            intangible property seizures by eminent domain. If so, suggest the
            process to a municipality in your state that is drowning in
            foreclosures.
          </p>
          <p>
            4) Consider getting a group together to research mortgages with
            broken chains of title in your area. A big push here could yield
            radical results.

            <b>Appendix II</b>: An example of how eminent domain principal
            reduction might work:
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose John and Mary Smith own a house on which the outstanding
            mortgage balance is $400,000. Suppose that if the house were sold
            today, its fair market value would be $200,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose someone offered to sell the Smith’s mortgage to you
            (i.e.,transfer to you the right to the monthly payments and to
            foreclose if payments stopped). How much would you be willing to
            pay?
          </p>
          <p>
            We can assume that Wall Street analysts have sophisticated computer
            programs that can
            <a href="http://www.miacanalytics.com/fs/ProdAndServ/mv.html"
              >accurately estimate how much any mortgage is worth</a
            >. Suppose the value of the Smiths’ mortgage via this analysis is
            $180,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            What Richmond wants to do is go to the mortgage holder and say,
            “Look, I know that if you offered this mortgage for sale on one of
            your fancy mortgage trading markets, someone might be willing to pay
            you $180,000 for it. Here’s $180,000. Give us the mortgage.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A rational mortgage holder would then say, “Well, I don’t know. How
            about $190,000?” And then Richmond might say, “$185,000.” And the
            current mortgage holder would likely say, “Okay, done!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Richmond, now the owner of this mortgage, would then turn around and
            give the Smiths a new mortgage with a principal amount of $200,000
            (the current market value). At this point the Smiths’ home is no
            longer underwater, the Smiths’ monthly payment drops significantly,
            their chance of being forced into default has been massively
            reduced, there is no reason for them to “walk away” from the
            property, the investor-owners of the previous mortgage have been
            fairly compensated, the Smiths might well spend the money they are
            saving on their mortgage payment at local shops—in other words,
            everyone is happy. Richmond would sell this new, improved, mortgage
            on the open market for the $180,000 they paid for it—or more,
            because now the prospect of default is very, very low— recouping the
            money it spent on the original purchase.
