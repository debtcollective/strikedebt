          <p>Dear Strike Debt Chapters and Friends,</p>
          <p>
            Over the past two months, Strike Debt has raised more than $500,000
            through the Rolling Jubilee fund&#8211;enough to purchase and
            abolish more than ten million dollars worth of defaulted medical
            debt. A first round of beneficiaries has just been notified that
            their debts have been erased, and a much larger announcement is
            scheduled for February of this year.  This bailout of the People by
            the People has touched a nerve, sparking an outpouring of generosity
            and a nation-wide conversation about the immoral and predatory
            debt-system of Wall Street. A consensus is emerging that no one
            should have to sign their future away to a creditor for access to
            the basic goods of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building on the phenomenal momentum of the Rolling Jubilee, Strike
            Debt is calling for a nation-wide visioning session entitled Debt,
            Privilege and Common Struggle: Where Do We Go From Here? to begin
            January 21st, 2013&#8211;Martin Luther King Day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strike Debt looks to Martin Luther King as a cultural symbol of a
            dream deferred&#8211;a dream not just of civic equality, but of a
            multiracial beloved community based on economic justice at local,
            national, and global scales. In his seminal 1967 speech &#8220;Where
            Do We Go From Here?&#8221; King named &#8220;the capitalistic
            system&#8221; itself as the obstacle to that dream, and called for a
            &#8220;restructuring of American society as a whole.&#8221;
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past year, Occupy Wall Street, Strike Debt, and our allies
            have highlighted debt as a primary mechanism of contemporary
            capitalist society&#8211;one that is inseparable from the history of
            racial inequality. A debt-financed existence has been both an
            alluring dream and a punishing nightmare for communities of color,
            who have been the hardest hit by predatory lending of all sorts from
            subprime mortgages to pay day loans as overall wages have stagnated
            and public services have been rolled back. Debt is a tie that binds
            the 99%, but it binds some of us more tightly than others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the week beginning January 21st, we will conjure the
            legacy of King and freedom struggles from around the world by
            gathering in places of worship, community centers, union-halls,
            classrooms, art spaces, dinner tables and living rooms to push
            forward the conversation started by the Rolling Jubilee. Where do we
            go from here? How do we get there? What would a bailout look like in
            your community? What alternative economic models can we imagine as
            we build a debt-resistance movement? What can we learn from history
            as we envision another world based on our obligations to our
            friends, families, and communities rather than to the 1%?
          </p>
          <p>
            Strike Debt NYC will host its visioning session at Judson Church in
            Manhattan from 12 PM to 3 PM. Friends and allies from across New
            York City and the Northeast are welcome, including those from the
            faith and labor communities. The family-friendly event will feature
            music, slideshows, and facilitated brainstorming sessions around
            themes including Movements, Targets, Cities, Cooperative Economics,
            Alternative Credit, and more! The event will conclude with food,
            drinks, and a performance by the Strike Debt Radical
            Children&#8217;s Theater, facilitated by the Little Red Squares
            Childcare Collective.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Strike Debt chapters elsewhere in the country interested in
            holding similar visioning events on or around J21, we encourage you
            to gather with friends and allies at whatever scale you feel is
            appropriate to have a meaningful conversation about building a
            debt-resistance movement&#8211;from a gathering of friends after
            church, over dinner or a drink at the bar to a full-on
            debt-assembly. We will soon be launching a &#8220;meet up&#8221;
            interface on the Strike Debt website, along with a visioning session
            toolkit with some suggestions about how to structure your event.
             Please let us know about your event here:
            <a href="mailto:organize@strikedebt.org">organize@strikedebt.org</a
            >.  Following the distributed events, we hope to gather report-backs
            from participants and consolidate them in an online document that
            can eventually give rise to a collective blueprint for a New
            Economic Vision.

          <p>In the words of MLK:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about
              &#8220;Where do we go from here?&#8221; that we must honestly face
              the fact that the movement must address itself to the question of
              restructuring the whole of American society. (Yes) There are forty
              million poor people here, and one day we must ask the question,
              &#8220;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&#8221;
              And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising a
              question about the economic system, about a broader distribution
              of wealth. When you ask that question, you begin to question the
              capitalistic economy. (Yes) And I&#8217;m simply saying that more
              and more, we&#8217;ve got to begin to ask questions about the
              whole society. We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars
              in life&#8217;s marketplace. (Yes) But one day we must come to see
              that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. (All
              right) It means that questions must be raised. And you see, my
              friends, when you deal with this you begin to ask the question,
              &#8220;Who owns the oil?&#8221; (Yes) You begin to ask the
              question, &#8220;Who owns the iron ore?&#8221; (Yes) You begin to
              ask the question, &#8220;Why is it that people have to pay water
              bills in a world that&#8217;s two-thirds water?&#8221; (All right)
              These are words that must be said. (All right)
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, don&#8217;t think you have me in a bind today. I&#8217;m not
              talking about communism. What I&#8217;m talking about is far
              beyond communism. (Yeah) My inspiration didn&#8217;t come from
              Karl Marx (Speak); my inspiration didn&#8217;t come from Engels;
              my inspiration didn&#8217;t come from Trotsky; my inspiration
              didn&#8217;t come from Lenin. Yes, I read Communist Manifesto and
              Das Kapital a long time ago (Well), and I saw that maybe Marx
              didn&#8217;t follow Hegel enough. (All right) He took his
              dialectics, but he left out his idealism and his spiritualism. And
              he went over to a German philosopher by the name of Feuerbach, and
              took his materialism and made it into a system that he called
              &#8220;dialectical materialism.&#8221; (Speak) I have to reject
              that.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I&#8217;m saying to you this morning is communism forgets
              that life is individual. (Yes) Capitalism forgets that life is
              social. (Yes, Go ahead) And the kingdom of brotherhood is found
              neither in the thesis of communism nor the antithesis of
              capitalism, but in a higher synthesis. (Speak) [applause] It is
              found in a higher synthesis (Come on) that combines the truths of
              both. (Yes) Now, when I say questioning the whole society, it
              means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism, the
              problem of economic exploitation, and the problem of war are all
              tied together. (All right) These are the triple evils that are
              interrelated.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, &#8220;Your whole structure (Yes) must be
              changed.&#8221; [applause] A nation that will keep people in
              slavery for 244 years will &#8220;thingify&#8221; them and make
              them things. (Speak) And therefore, they will exploit them and
              poor people generally economically. (Yes) And a nation that will
              exploit economically will have to have foreign investments and
              everything else, and it will have to use its military might to
              protect them. All of these problems are tied together. (Yes)
              [applause]
            </p>
