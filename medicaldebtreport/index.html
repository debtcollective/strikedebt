        <h1 class="entry-title">Death By For-Profit Health Care</h1>

        <div class="entry-content">
          <h2 id="exec">Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            This report is part of an ongoing effort by a group of health care
            practitioners, lawyers, researchers, and activists to expose the
            disastrous impact of medical debt and for-profit health care on
            families and individuals in the United States. Private health care
            enriches a few—insurance companies, private equity firms,
            pharmaceutical companies, debt collectors, and global investors—at
            the expense of everyone else. Medical debt is a weapon of the class
            war because when patients cannot afford medical care, they are
            forced into debt, often with far-ranging and catastrophic
            consequences. As the rate of uninsured has grown, local governments
            have looked to state subsidies for private health insurance as a
            band-aid solution. Massachusetts has implemented such a program, and
            the Obama Administration’s Affordable Care Act has expanded this
            initiative on a national scale. Unfortunately, the ACA will not
            solve the problem because its primary goal is to expand the
            market-based system that has already proved to be a miserable
            failure. Insurance companies profit by denying coverage. As costs
            rise and benefits shrink, patients will continue to pay the price.
            We are in a major health care crisis, the consequences of which will
            be felt for decades to come. The only real solutions are: a
            grassroots social movement to demand universal health care, an end
            to the scourge of medical debt, and a national conversation on the
            meaning of health and wellness.
          </p>
          <h2 id="classwar">Medical Debt: A Weapon of Class War</h2>
          <p>
            The price of for-profit medical care is increasing at a relentless
            pace while quality is declining. Fifty million people have no
            insurance and 77 million have trouble paying medical bills
            (Rukavina). Despite these inequities, the US spends more on care
            than any other wealthy country in the world. The for-profit health
            care industry sucks up 18% of Gross Domestic Product, more than
            twice what countries that have publicly-financed health care spend.
            Despite the high cost, Americans are sicker and die earlier than
            people in other developed nations (“Shorter Lives”).
          </p>
          <p>
            People without insurance must privately finance health care. Less
            well understood, however, is that medical debt is not only a problem
            for those without coverage. One in five adults who are privately
            insured struggles to pay medical bills. Even more scandalous is the
            fact that Americans are paying more for weaker coverage (“Shorter
            Lives”). According to the Commonwealth Fund, the cost of insurance
            has outpaced wage increases for the last ten years. Employers are
            shifting these costs to employees and their families. Premiums
            increased 62% from 2003 to 2011 (“State Trends”). For at least ten
            million Americans, deductibles are so high that their insurance
            plans are little more than scams, providing a false sense of
            security in hard times (Young).
          </p>
          <p>
            The cost of health care has also risen faster than inflation. As a
            result, over the last few years, families have had little choice but
            to accept lower wages to hold on to benefits that, in the case of a
            serious illness or accident, may not protect them from financial
            disaster. For many working people, the trade-off is simple: your
            money or your life. If you have a job and insurance, you may feel
            that you are protected. But that is false. No one is truly safe from
            a for-profit health care industry that preys on patients and
            families at the most vulnerable moments. Since insurance companies
            and for-profit providers also fund political campaigns, we can
            expect no help from politicians. The best hope we have is to ally
            with others in our circumstances to fight back and claim health care
            as a human right.
          </p>
          <h2 id="risk">We’re All at Risk</h2>
          <p>
            Almost everyone is affected by medical debt. The for-profit health
            care industry is designed to benefit a few at the expense of the
            rest. Debtors and non-debtors alike are forced to pay out-of- pocket
            for everything from basic care to life-saving operations. As
            patients, most of us understand instinctually that someone is making
            out like a bandit when we get sick. This becomes clear the minute
            you walk into a doctor’s office or a hospital where you open your
            wallet to make an up-front payment, sometimes called a co-pay,
            before seeing a doctor. The costs can start piling up from there,
            even if you have insurance. If you have a serious illness or
            accident, it’s unlikely that your insurance will cover all—or even
            most—of the care you need. What insurance doesn’t pay, you’re
            responsible for. Predictably, medical debt discriminates along
            familiar lines. According the Commonwealth Fund,
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Among the working-age population, 39% of women have medical bill
              problems, compared with just 25% of men. More than half of
              working-age African Americans (52%) report medical bill problems,
              in contrast with 34% of Hispanics and 28% of whites (“Seeing
              Red”).
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Although medical debt affects some more than others, it cuts across
            lines of class, race, and gender. In fact, rates of medical
            indebtedness are comparable for people with and without insurance
            (“Consequences”). Insurance companies make a profit by denying
            claims. In the words of Dr. David Himmelstein, of Physicians for a
            National Health Program,
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Private health insurance is akin to an umbrella that melts in the
              rain. It simply isn’t there for you when you most need it
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            How long are we willing to stand under our worthless umbrellas and
            pray that it doesn’t rain? Many health plans don’t cover all the
            treatments for a serious illness or accident. Others limit the total
            amount of benefits or require absurdly high deductibles, putting
            necessary care out of reach for people who believe they are
            protected (“Seeing Red”). According to the Access Project, a
            non-profit research and advocacy organization,
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Americans spent $300 billion on out-of-pocket costs in 2010; a
              figure over and above the cost of health insurance premiums
              (Rukavina).
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            People will say that we can’t afford universal health care, that
            those of us who believe otherwise are living a foolish dream. But
            they are wrong. The dreamers have it right this time. We’re not
            making an argument about affordability or appealing for the creation
            of what some call the “Welfare State.” We’re saying that it is time
            to pay attention to the overwhelming evidence that for-profit health
            care is killing us. It’s time to wake up from our national health
            care nightmare.
          </p>
          <h2 id="eat">Eat The Young</h2>
          <p>
            Who is paying the price for our profit- based system? It may be
            obvious that low-income people pay a higher percentage of their
            income for health care. But the young are also at a high risk for
            incurring medical debt. This is because those from the ages of 19 to
            29 are more likely to lack health insurance<br />
            than older Americans. Many low-wage employers that hire young adults
            do not provide coverage, and since the 2008 financial crisis, new
            college graduates have disproportionately high rates of unemployment
            and underemployment. Through a toxic combination of college loans,
            medical debt, and a recession caused by banks, many people’s
            financial lives are ruined before they are even out of their
            twenties. Is this what we want for young people in America? The
            evidence that publicly-funded care is far better than our current
            system is staggering.
          </p>
          <p>
            It turns out, when it comes to medical debt, it is better to be over
            65 and sick than to be young and healthy (Garcia). Older people
            actually have the lowest rates of medical debt because they qualify
            for government-supported programs like Medicare. From the right and
            left of the political establishment, we hear no end of fearmongering
            about “socialism” and how awful it would be if health care became a
            public benefit, like it is in many countries around the world. But
            the truth is that Americans on Medicare and Medicaid are much less
            likely to lay awake at night fearing that the next medical procedure
            will force them into bankruptcy or foreclosure. It’s time to rethink
            what obligations we owe to the young, what kind of promises we want
            to make to those who come after us, and how we intend to keep them.

            Medical Debt and Bankruptcy: The Insurance Hoax
          </h2>
          <p>
            Bankruptcy is often presumed to be the result of profligate living
            by consumers who overspent on luxury items. Don’t live beyond your
            means is common advice, as if personal responsibility is the only
            thing that matters in an economy that almost collapsed only 5 years
            ago. In fact, people are being forced into bankruptcy in America
            because they had the audacity to get sick without millions of
            dollars in the bank. Or, they believed their private health plan
            would protect them from the worst. By the time many realize that
            for-profit health care is a hoax, it’s too late. The crisis is
            gaining steam. Just 30 years ago, debtors rarely filed for
            bankruptcy as a result of a medical problem. Today, an astonishing
            62% of personal bankruptcies are linked to medical debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            The link between medical debt and bankruptcy also shatters the myth
            of personal responsibility that makes many of us feel as if we are
            to blame if we can’t afford basic needs. According to a report in
            the American Journal of Medicine, most people who declare bankruptcy
            as a result of medical debt had insurance at the time they incurred
            the debt (Himmelstein). Furthermore, the majority of medical debtors
            who declared bankruptcy attended college, owned their own home, and
            had middle-class jobs. They did everything “right,” yet they were
            still financially devastated when a member of their family got sick
            or had an accident.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might think that a sharp uptick in the number of medical debtors
            filing for bankruptcy would prompt the government to step in. After
            all, no one chooses to go into medical debt. Yet, our delusional
            Congress assumed people were abusing the bankruptcy law when their
            lives were turned upside down by an unexpected medical expense. In
            2005, Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
            Protection Act which made it even more difficult for people to file
            for bankruptcy. During this same period, the number of under-insured
            grew from 15.6 million people to 25.2 million (Himmelstein).
          </p>
          <p>
            To sum up the catastrophe: as a response to the rising cost of care
            and a growing number of Americans who cannot afford their medical
            bills, Congress responded by throwing up more barriers to
            bankruptcy. It’s not that bankruptcy is a real solution, since it
            does not address the fundamental economic conditions that pushed
            individuals to bankruptcy in the first place. The point is that our
            elected representatives are out of touch and out of time. They have
            little to offer us but moralizing and useless reforms. The only
            reasonable response is collective action to create a health care
            program that reimagines the meaning of care and puts people before
            profits.
          </p>
          <h2 id="hospitals">Disappearing Public Hospitals</h2>
          <p>
            If you have ever needed medical care but didn’t have insurance, you
            most likely went to a public hospital or clinic. There are
            approximately 1,131 public hospitals in the US (Fraze). These
            institutions, which serve 75% more uninsured patients than their
            private counterparts, are a vital resource for low-income and
            uninsured patients. Yet, public hospitals are disappearing. Like
            public schools, they have been swept up in a wave of privatization:
            the public sector is being dismantled to create new profit streams
            for the superrich, most of whom have never been to the local
            communities from which they are siphoning wealth. If your public
            hospital seems disorganized and dilapidated, it is easy to assume
            that it is being mismanaged at the local level. Hospitals have also
            been caught up in the same global economic changes that are at the
            root of the rising cost of care and ballooning rates of medical
            debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hospital privatization is sweeping the country, and states like New
            York and Louisiana are leading the way. In early 2013, Governor
            Cuomo announced a budget that would mark the beginning of the end of
            publicly-funded hospitals in New York state. He is seeking to close
            Brooklyn’s Long Island College Hospital and Interfaith Medical
            Center and replace them with private versions (Frost). The property
            where the hospital sits is also being eyed by developers as a
            location for a luxury condominium (Lutz). Shuttering LICH is a
            significant step that has ramifications far beyond the fate of one
            institution. It would set a precedent for turning public hospitals
            over to the private sector, a move that Assemblywoman Joan Millman
            called “troubling” because private hospitals have a “fiduciary
            responsibility to their stockholders, not their patients.” In an era
            when tens of millions of patients are drowning in medical debt and
            the number of uninsured is on the rise, officials like Cuomo
            actually believe the solution is to eliminate those few institutions
            that serve people in need to create a new market for the global
            investor class.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no better example of a clueless official who seems to
            reside on a different planet from his constituents than Louisiana’s
            Governor Bobby Jindal. In 2012, Jindal proposed funding cuts for the
            state’s health care programs to plug a $165.5 million budget gap.
            The impact on public hospitals will be disastrous, forcing them to
            reduce the care they provide to Medicaid patients and to those
            without insurance. Louisiana State University alone plans to lay off
            1,495 hospital employees and cut services at seven hospitals across
            the state. Some buildings will simply be abandoned and left to rot
            (Shuler). Jindal is also planning to restructure the state’s health
            care system, turning several public hospitals over to the private
            sector. Private firms would receive public dollars to run hospitals
            whose first order of business is to earn returns for investors.
            Louisiana State Sen. Francis Thompson openly declared his opposition
            to the plan. “I’m afraid&#8230;we may get picked like a buzzard does
            a dead animal,” he said (Millhollon).
          </p>
          <p>
            Thompson’s description is accurate. The public sector is a carcass
            being picked to the bone by private sector vultures. Privatization
            will deepen the debt crisis by forcing hospitals to focus on their
            credit rating, not patient care. As described below, credit rating
            agencies are already among the most powerful corporations in the
            world. Under threat of a reduced rating, hospitals will be under
            even more pressure to aggressively pursue medical debtors. They will
            also offer less care to low-income patients because the bond ratings
            of hospitals can be negatively impacted if hospitals provide too
            much charitable care. Yes, too much charitable care is a thing that
            exists in the world of Wall Street finance. When hospitals are
            privately financed, bond rating agencies determine our future
            (Zieger).
          </p>
          <p>
            Another world is possible. Under a humane health care system, we
            would begin to ask which measures of success really matter. We would
            start with the big questions: what does it mean to live a healthy
            life and how do we get there together? But under Wall Street’s
            influence, hospitals are analyzed according to financial metrics,
            such as debt per bed and local market competition. The threat of
            lower bond ratings forces hospitals to hire Wall Street consultants,
            to cut back on purchases of medical equipment, to postpone the
            hiring of medical personnel, and to lay off staff. Indeed, in New
            York City, an investment banker named Stephen Berger has been
            recruited to drive the nails into the coffins of community hospitals
            in order to create more opportunities for Wall Street to make money
            (Benson). Debt starts a vicious cycle that keeps a hospital from
            focusing on patients. This is a kind of madness, a nightmare from
            which we must finally awaken.
          </p>
          <h2>The Debt Spiral</h2>
          <p>
            The madness extends beyond the walls of the hospital. Our cities and
            towns are being sucked dry by Wall Street and by global investors
            who demand a profit at any cost. In many cases, hospitals are
            responding to the crisis by aggressively trying to extract money
            from patients. It starts before patients even leave the hospital. In
            2012, the Minnesota Attorney General began an investigation of
            Accretive Health, one the largest medical debt collection firms in
            the country. Documents reveal that debt collectors were allowed into
            hospitals where they were indistinguishable from regular hospital
            staff. According to the New York Times, such collectors routinely
            demand [that patients] pay outstanding bills and may discourage them
            from seeking emergency care at all.” This is a violation of a
            federal law requiring hospitals to provide care to anyone who needs
            it. In Minnesota, the mother of a child who needed surgery reported
            that collectors hounded her for payment before her son received
            care. She did not know the agents who approached her were debt
            collectors. “You really feel hoodwinked,” she said. These collection
            tactics are becoming business-as-usual. A for-profit health care
            system means health care is a luxury enjoyed by those who can afford
            it. The rest of us must beg, borrow, and endure harassment to get
            the services we deserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            The debt spiral doesn’t stop with medical debt. Once the bills pile
            up, studies show that people borrow even more to make ends meet. As
            described<br />
            in the Debt Resistors’ Operations Manual, people who can’t afford
            medical care turn to credit cards, the so-called “plastic safety
            net,” to pay for daily necessities (Zandt). Thus, credit card debt,
            often assumed to be the result of overspending by impulsive
            shoppers, is actually inseparable from our for-profit health care
            system. Insurance companies and investors make a killing by
            withholding care, then credit card companies clean us out a second
            time by charging usurious interest rates and adding late fees to our
            accounts when we cannot pay. A report by the public policy group
            Demos, “Borrowing to Stay Healthy,” reports that
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Twenty-nine percent of low- and middle-income households with
              credit card debt reported that medical expenses contributed to
              their current level of credit card debt.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Reports like these illustrate the circular logic of the debt spiral.
            When people can’t pay doctor bills, they often turn to other forms
            of credit, which compounds the problem. Because health insurance is
            tied to employment, a serious medical condition can limit a person’s
            ability to work, earn income, and remain on a health plan. Get sick.
            Can’t work. Lose health care. Go into debt. Take on more debt. When
            medical debt leads to consumer debt, it can cause dire consequences.
            Health Affairs researchers Robert W. Seifert and Mark Rukavina<br />
            explained that
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              People with medical debt are often subject to legal judgments,
              wage garnishment, attachment of assets including bank accounts, or
              liens on their homes, which can lead to foreclosure.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            It might be surprising that many medical debtors own their own
            homes. In fact, people with medical debt and those without have
            equal rates of home ownership. But there is one important
            difference: those with medical debt are more likely to use their
            homes as collateral for loans or take out a second mortgage to pay
            the bills. There is no better barometer of our time than the fact
            that owning a home pushes us deeper into the debt trap. The
            capitalist dream has led us down a dark path. The future has been
            gambled away. Millions have tapped into retirement funds to pay
            medical debt (Garcia). The debt spiral—from medical debt to consumer
            debt to foreclosure and a dwindling retirement account—shatters the
            myth of personal responsibility. Debt is a rigged system of
            overlapping and mutually reinforcing types. For many, there is no
            exit.
          </p>
          <h2 id="shame">The Shame of Debt</h2>
          <p>
            To be in debt is a shameful thing. Most of us have been made to feel
            like our debts are our fault, even though one in seven adults in the
            US is currently being pursued by a debt collector and more and more
            of us are in debt for basic necessities like housing, education, and
            health care. Medical debt is a source of shame that affects people’s
            overall health.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s quite simple, really. When people can’t afford to see a doctor,
            they don’t. Patients who can’t afford to pay—or who have accrued
            medical debt—are less likely to seek out care because they are
            ashamed about their debt and don’t want to end up owing more
            (“Consequences”). This ultimately leads to more health problems and
            increases the costs of care. A study in the Journal of General
            Internal Medicine showed that
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Over two-thirds of those who either had a current medical debt or
              had been referred to a collection agency reported that it caused
              them to seek alternative sites of care or to delay or avoid
              seeking subsequent care when needed.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            When Republicans in Congress invented a boogeyman called “death
            panels” during the 2008 presidential campaign, they weren’t talking
            about the for-profit health care industry. But they should have
            been. One report showed that 45% of medical debtors put off
            necessary care to avoid debt (Garcia). The US health care system is
            making people sick and keeping them that way because illness is
            profitable (Jacoby). Is that the kind of health care system we want?
            Is that the kind of world we want?

          <h2 id="dystopian">
            Medical Debt and the Dystopian Nightmare of Credit Scoring
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you’re wondering why you have a low credit score or why you never
            seem to qualify for the lowest interest rates on home, car, or other
            loans, the problem may be medical debt. This is true even if you
            paid an overdue medical bill. The Federal Reserve has shown that
            more than half of all collection accounts that negatively impact
            credit reports are medical debt (Avery). This is a result of the
            fact that health care costs are on the rise and tens of millions are
            uninsured. But it is also because medical debt is treated
            differently from other kinds of debt. Private health insurance
            reimbursement is incredibly cumbersome. Different benefits are often
            covered by different companies and at different rates, leading to a
            lengthy, circuitous billing process that often leaves patients
            holding the bag. If you have ever received a medical bill that you
            didn’t understand or that you thought your insurance was supposed to
            cover, you have been caught up in this Kafkaesque system. If you
            have ever received a letter from a health care provider stamped with
            the notice “This Is Not A Bill,” or if you have signed a form at a
            doctor’s office promising to pay anything your insurance fails to
            cover, you have been an unwitting victim in the tangled web of
            medical billing, an industry that thrives on patient and health care
            provider confusion. According to Rukavina,
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              One study found that nearly one-third of respondents let a medical
              bill go to a collection agency because they did not understand the
              bill or explanation of benefits statement. Another study estimated
              14 million American adults said that a medical bill was sent to a
              collection agency because of a billing mistake.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Confusion is the grease that keeps the wheels of the medical
            collections industry turning. It’s hard not to think that billing
            “mistakes” may not be mistakes at all but part of an intentional
            strategy to keep patients in the dark and in the red. In addition to
            patient confusion, medical debt is more likely to end up in
            collection because hospitals routinely sell medical debt to debt
            collectors after 60-90 days of nonpayment, far less than the
            customary 180 days for other kinds of debt. Health care providers
            rarely report paid medical bills to the credit reporting agencies.
            So, even if you are billed in error, your health care provider may
            send your bill to a collection agency before you can dispute the
            charge (Bernard). Once in default, a medical debt stays on a credit
            report for up to 7 years, even if you pay the bill. Research by the
            Commonwealth Fund shows that, in 2010, 9.2 million people wound up
            in default on a medical bill because of a billing mistake (“Help”).
          </p>
          <p>
            These mistakes have serious consequences. According to evidence
            obtained by the Access Project, a single paid medical bill can lower
            a consumer credit score by as many as 80 points. That means you will
            pay a higher interest rate for almost anything else you want to buy
            on credit, including a home or a car. The fact that a relatively
            small medical bill can end up costing thousands in interest charges
            down the line demonstrates the obscene power of the credit rating
            agencies. Consumer protection attorney Robert Nahoum told Strike
            Debt:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              I’ve never seen three companies with more power over the American
              consumer than the top three credit reporting agencies, Equifax,
              TransUnion, and Experian. There’s very little consumers can do.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            If patients are powerless, so are many health care providers. It’s
            important to note that your doctor may be just as confused as you
            are. Strike Debt has talked to health care workers around the
            country, and they tell us that they are as frustrated as patients
            when it comes to medical billing. Why do insurance companies and
            ratings agencies have so much power over our lives? Why do we live
            in such perpetual confusion? These questions are important to ask
            when we think of what it means to be healthy and what kind of
            economy we need to sustain life.
          </p>
          <p>
            We might also ask why our elected officials don’t put a stop to
            predatory medical billing and curb the power of the ratings
            agencies. The Medical Debt Relief Act attempts to prohibit credit
            reporting agencies from listing medical debts on credit scores. Yet,
            even this minor reform has little chance of passing because the
            credit rating agencies and insurance companies are a powerful lobby
            in Washington. And even if the MDRA were to make it through the
            Senate, it only applies to paid medical bills. As usual, Congress
            lacks the political will to challenge the power structure that puts
            people in debt and keeps them that way. Debt is a tool of capitalist
            exploitation, and we can’t eliminate the debt without rethinking the
            larger economic system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, the evidence actually indicates that if we don’t act things
            will get worse for patients and debtors before they get better. FICO
            has begun developing<br />
            a special ratings system to rank potential patients on how likely
            they are to pay their medical bills (Gipson). Like having a bar code
            tattooed on your forehead, we could be looking at a brave new world
            in which your credit rating determines not only whether you can
            obtain a credit card but whether you receive medical care when you
            get sick.
          </p>
          <h2 id="profits">Who Profits from Medical Debt?</h2>
          <p>
            No one disputes that our health care system is for profit. But whose
            profit? Patients are certainly losing the health care battle.
            “There’s a tendency to attribute [the high cost of care] to
            minorities or those with severe health problems,” Matthias Rumpf of
            the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has
            explained. Actually, the evidence shows that
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Even Americans with health insurance and those who have the
              highest education and income levels fall behind their counterparts
              in other parts of the world (McHaney).
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            It is clear that insurance companies, global investors, and credit
            ratings agencies are reaping a massive windfall. Profiteers are
            descending on the health care industry from all corners of the
            finance world. One of the largest and most profitable health care
            providers, HCA, runs 163 hospitals across the country. The company
            is also under investigation by the Justice Department for defrauding
            Medicare by performing unnecessary heart surgeries on unwitting
            patients (Koleva). And, this year, HCA was ordered to pay a $162
            million fine for failing to make agreed-upon repairs to run-down
            hospitals in Missouri as well as for reneging on a promise to
            provide charity care to low-income patients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who is profiting from this criminal activity? HCA, which was founded
            by former Senate majority leader Bill Frist’s family, is primarily
            owned by Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mitt
            Romney. Bain investors are not turned off in the least by how HCA
            treats patients. In fact, according to the New York Times,
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The financial performance has been so impressive that HCA has
              become a model for the industry. Its success inspired 35 buyouts
              of hospitals or chains of facilities in the last two and a half
              years by private equity firms eager to repeat that windfall
              (Creswell and Abelson).
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In a private health care system, nothing—not fraud or patient abuse
            or crumbling buildings—interferes with the relentless drive for
            corporate profit. In fact, the same private equity firms that
            control many hospitals also have a stake in debt collections
            companies. This means that companies like Bain Capital that own the
            hospital networks that put us into debt also invest in many of the
            firms that try to collect that debt from us. Once the web is spun,
            there’s no way the 1% can lose. Most of us are focused on daily
            life: trying to earn enough to put food on the table and care for
            the people we love. We lay awake at night worrying about a sick
            child and pray our insurance policies will protect us if tragedy
            strikes. Wall Street knows that few people have the luxury of paying
            attention to what’s really going on in their boardrooms. That is why
            it is more important than ever to change the conversation about
            medical debt and our for-profit health care system.
          </p>
          <h2 id="aca">
            Won’t Obama’s Affordable Care Act Reduce Medical Debt?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The fact that many liberals greeted the passage of the Obama
            administration’s health reform law with such delight is downright
            shocking when we consider its glaring inadequacies. In 2014, states
            will be required to create exchanges in which people can purchase
            private insurance. But, as PNHP physician Margaret Flowers has
            explained, the majority of these plans will not offer full coverage.
            And people who purchase insurance through an exchange will end up
            with plans that cover 70% or less of the cost of health care. Since
            even a short hospital stay can cost tens of thousands of dollars,
            the math is not on the side of people who don’t already have huge
            bank accounts. Insurance companies profit by denying coverage. Now,
            thanks to the Affordable Care Act, that strategy will be codified
            into law. Insurance companies will also gain access to a whole new
            market for their products while offering worthless umbrellas in
            return.
          </p>
          <p>
            It gets worse. The federal subsidy that is supposed to help people
            purchase health insurance under the new law only applies to
            individuals, not families. So, depending on your income level, if
            you want to purchase coverage through an exchange, you’ll be left
            with two options: pay market rate for private insurance or go
            without. The people who will benefit from an expansion of our
            market-based insurance system are not patients. Instead, the 1%, who
            already control the profit-driven health care system, will get a
            payout every time the rest of us see a doctor. Most appalling,
            however, is that more than 20 million people will not be covered
            under the new law (Babcock).
          </p>
          <p>
            It makes no sense to expand a failed market and demand that people
            participate in it, especially when we already have evidence that
            such reforms don’t work. In Massachusetts, for example, health care
            reform did not stem the tide of bankruptcies linked to medical debt
            (Himmelstein, “Medical”). There is simply little evidence that the
            ACA will do much beyond worsening an already grave labor crisis.
            Reports are emerging that employers, especially colleges and
            universities, are planning to cut employees’ hours in order to avoid
            offering health benefits under the ACA (Zorn).
          </p>
          <p>
            Considering what we know, the fact that many treated the passage of
            the ACA as a progressive victory seems like magical thinking. As
            Flowers noted, public relations and marketing expenses account for
            more than one-third of the cost of care. Even the deficit-crazed
            political establishment seems to be suffering from willful
            blindness. According to the Washington Post, if we had the
            per-person health costs of France or Germany, two countries with
            publically-funded health care, “America’s deficits would vanish”
            (Klein). It’s time to follow the money and it’s time to get real.
            According to research conducted by Physicians for a National Health
            Program, a single-payer system could save $400 billion per year. Yet
            politicians focused on deficit reduction would scoff at the
            suggestion that we publicly fund health care in America.
          </p>
          <h2 id="lifeordebt">Life or Debt?</h2>
          <p>
            For-profit health care kills. In 2007, in Prince George’s County,
            Maryland, a twelve-year-old boy named Deamonte Driver died from a
            toothache. He had an infection, but his mother could not afford to
            take him to a dentist (Otto). Deamonte lost his life because he did
            not receive antibiotics that would have cost $80. This is the world
            we live in today. What kind of world do we want? Universal,
            single-payer medical care would be a short-term step in the right
            direction. But it’s not the ultimate solution. State-financed care
            would give us, above all, a chance to take a step back from the
            relentless bills and the anxiety that comes from not knowing if
            we’ll be able to afford to care for ourselves and our loved ones. It
            would give us a chance to ask if there are really only two choices:
            private or public, corporate or federal. It would give us, at long
            last, what we really need: the freedom to ask larger questions about
            the meaning of health and how we can work together to provide it to
            ourselves, to our families, and to those who come after us. We have
            a difficult road ahead. But there is no doubt that the private
            insurance industry is wholly inadequate to the task. Our lives are
            in jeopardy because medical care in the US is a profit-making
            enterprise that enriches the few at the expense of the rest of us.
            Reform won’t do in the long run. Politicians do not have the will to
            take the necessary steps. As Dr. Steffie Woolhandler of PNHP makes
            clear,
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              It’s not your fault if you’re in debt and it’s particularly not
              your fault if you’re in debt because of a medical problem. This is
              unfair. No other developed nation forces people to go into debt
              because they get sick (“Time To End”).
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The situation we face is not our fault, but it’s our job to take a
            stand together. The only real solution is a bottom-up, grassroots
            movement that puts people before profits. It will not be given to us
            by benefactors or by politicians who depend on Wall Street funding
            for reelection. It’s up to us. The time is now. It’s life or debt.
