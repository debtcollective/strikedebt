          <p>[Updated October 17, 2014]</p>
          <p>
            How much would it cost to make every public two- and four-year
            college and university in the United States tuition-free for all
            students?  Much less than you think.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to our estimate, after stripping off the amount that the
            government <i>already</i> spends to subsidize higher education —
            including at predatory for-profit institutions — the total amount of
            new money necessary would be as little as $15 billion a year. 
            Fifteen billion is a lot of money, to be sure, but within the scope
            of the federal budget it is a fraction of one percent of yearly
            spending — merely a rounding error.
          </p>
          <p>Here’s how we arrived at that astonishing figure.</p>
          <p>
            In the 2012-2013 academic year, students spent $61.8 billion on
            tuition for public colleges and universities (<a
              href="http://www.sheeo.org/sites/default/files/publications/SHEF_FY13_04292014.pdf"
              target="_blank"
              >source</a
            >, page 7).  That’s our starting point.  But, as we said above, the
            government is already subsidizing that figure via various programs
            which would no longer be needed if tuition were simply free. 
            Additionally, predatory <i>for-profit</i> colleges receive billions
            in federal subsidies which simply channel taxpayer money straight
            into the pockets of Wall Street investors while saddling students
            with worthless degrees and a crushing debt load.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2012-2013 the government spent $32.3 billion in Pell Grants (<a
              href="https://trends.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/student-aid-2013-full-report.pdf"

              >source,</a
            >
            page 3).  How much of that went to shady for-profit schools?  As
            much as 21% — more than $6.7 billion (<a
              href="http://www2.ed.gov/finaid/prof/resources/data/pell-2012-13/pell-eoy-2012-13.html"

              >source</a
            >, page 4]) specifically target veterans for enrollment, and so they
            took in roughly $1.7 billion in GI Bill monies in 2012-2013 (<a

              target="_blank"
              >source</a
            >, page i).
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no reason to squander even a penny of public money on these
            fraudulent operations.  These combined savings would amount to $8.4
            billion, which, subtracted from that $61.8 billion figure above,
            would give us a remaining cost of $53.4 billion for 2012-2013.

            The outcome would be a drastic reduction in the vast student debt
            burden (approaching $1.3 trillion) — the single most significant

            Some will say this is a utopian proposition.  But virtually every
            other industrialized nation (and many a developing country) has
            managed to offer free public higher education for decades.  Even in
            this era of fiscal austerity, governments in countries as disparate

            have recently announced they are eliminating tuition costs
            altogether.  In the U.S. we cannot continue to mortgage the lifetime
            earnings of students without severely limiting their opportunities
            and damaging the fabric of our democratic life.

            When you hear elected officials and political interest groups
            agonizing over the intractability of the student debt crisis, while
            protecting a status quo that funnels money to Wall Street banks and
            other higher ed profiteers, ask them where their priorities really
            are.

            government currently spends on an array of pointless programs.  For

            guarantee fair labor conditions for the 1.3 million contingent
            faculty members — over 75% of the university teaching force — who
            make an average salary of $25,000 per year.  Doubling their salaries
            to match the current median pay for a full-time professor would
            still only cost $61.75 billion per year (<a

            These are only a handful of alternative funding sources.  If you
            look around, you’ll have little trouble locating that $15 billion —
            a small price to pay for the universal, tuition-free public higher
            education that more and more of the world’s citizenry are demanding
            of twenty-first century democracies.
