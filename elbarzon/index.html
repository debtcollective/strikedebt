          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            As part of my work with Strike Debt, I have been reexamining the
            history of debt resistance in order to place our organization in a
            historic perspective. Elsewhere, I have studied ancient, medieval,
            and modern debtors’ organizations, but here I want to examine a
            particular case, that of El Barzón. The El Barzón movement in the
            1990s had a significant impact on Mexican society and is close
            enough to us in time and space to indicate some of the perennial
            problems and possibilities of debtors’ movements that are relevant
            to Strike Debt.
          </p>
          <h3>Prolegomena to a History of Debt Resistance</h3>
          <p>
            El Barzón is a mass organization of debtors that, at its height, had
            half a million members and chapters all over Mexico. It provided to
            its members both legal aid and “muscle” to resist foreclosures and
            repossessions due to debt default. Before we re-create and review El
            Barzón’s story in thought, we should recognize that there are many
            forms of debt and many different kinds of debtors. As a consequence
            there are many forms of debt resistance. One of the most important
            distinctions is that of debt contracted in order to make more money,
            what I call “profit debt,” and debt contracted to purchase a
            commodity that satisfies some nonmonetary need or desire, what I
            call “use-value debt.”
          </p>
          <p>
            To get our bearings, let us see how these kinds of debt appear in
            the world of contemporary economics statistics. “Profit debt” is
            called “corporate debt” (comprising the debt of both “financial” and
            “nonfinancial” corporations), and “use-value debt” is called
            “household debt.” Contemporary US “corporate debt” is approximately
            $26 trillion, while “household debt” is approximately $13.5
            trillion.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a caveat that I should make at this juncture. Although, for
            the most part, proletarians take on use-value debt and capitalists
            profit debt, in the history of debt resistance these debt categories
            do not always coincide with a simple class dichotomy. Let us take a
            moment to examine these “failures of coincidence” between class and
            debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many noncapitalists who take out loans “to make money” in
            order to supplement a largely subsistence livelihood (for in a
            monetary society some money is necessary even for a subsistence
            life). Many debt resistance movements have been led by small farmers
            or small businesspeople who had some kind of collateral (usually
            land) and were producing for or selling in a market in order to earn
            their livelihoods. Another failed coincidence arises because
            capitalists act as consumers as well. They can get into debt in
            order to purchase commodities for their use value—that is, they buy
            yachts, expensive vacations, and so on—without an immediate
            intention to gain some profit on the commodity purchased. They do,
            of course, recognize that some commodity purchases for the purpose
            of enjoyment such as a Basquiat painting can eventually become “good
            investments.” Indeed, some capitalists can become so indebted due to
            their “use-value debts” that they organize against their class
            colleagues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still another failure of coincidence arises because some
            proletarians (who are not always class-conscious angels) attempt to
            transform use-value debt into a form of profit debt. Thus, although
            much of the real estate speculation in the 2000s was due to
            capitalists (in financial institutions), some proletarians became
            indebted in order to speculate on the prices of second or even third
            homes. Clearly, they were trying to use debt as a way to make real
            estate profit and were not using these homes as a means to satisfy
            their need for housing.
          </p>
          <p>
            An even more troubling case of this failure of coincidence is the
            question of student loan debt. Most contemporary proletarians are
            told that they have to “invest in themselves” and pay for
            postsecondary education in order to earn higher wages than their
            friends who only graduate from high school. Since they do not have
            the immediate funds to pay the high tuition fees, they often have to
            take out loans. Are these use-value debts or are they profit debts?
            Doesn’t student loan debt imply a way of borrowing money to make
            money, that is, a profit debt? But, at the same time, the “more
            money” in question is in the form of wages not profits, so is one’s
            labor power a form of capital? Just because neoliberal economists
            say it is does not make it so. They do not have the power to
            magically transform every worker into a little capitalist! Nor can
            they, with the same wand, transform wages into profits. On the
            contrary, the labor power that is sold in the labor market is a
            commodity simply because workers have no choice but to sell it to
            live. The profits that labor power generates when put to work (both
            in the sphere of production and reproduction) are only for the
            employers and their class.
          </p>
          <p>
            The point of these prolegomena is to show that, due to these
            failures of coincidence, one often finds complex interclass
            alliances in debt resistance movements. For example, in the struggle
            against debt imprisonment in the US in the nineteenth century,
            formerly wealthy capitalists and dirt-poor farmers fought in the
            same campaign because they both were liable to find themselves in
            the same prisons.

            /></a>
          </p>
          <h3>El Barzón: A Late Twentieth-Century Debtors’ Organization</h3>
          <p>
            In order to better understand this complexity, I will consider a
            remarkable recent debtors’ struggle against profit and use-value
            debt in Mexico organized by El Barzón. In 1994 the Mexican peso
            dramatically lost value compared to the US dollar, and this set off
            a steep rise in inflation that increased the interest on
            variable-rate loans and also made loans (including mortgages) that
            were denominated in US dollars (as many were) up to ten times
            larger. The outcome brought into default nearly 30 percent of the
            Mexican people indebted to banks.
          </p>
          <p>
            These developments triggered the dramatic expansion of a formerly
            little-known debtors’ organization that began in Jalisco state in
            1993. It was devoted to easing the burden of indebted small farmers
            and took its name from the ring that binds the yoke with the plow.
            Later on, this agricultural root image was changed to another
            agricultural image, a green tractor, which remained the
            organization’s logo. El Barzón first expanded into other
            agricultural states, but in 1994 El Barzón’s members agreed on a
            proposal to struggle against additional kinds of debt. This was a
            remarkably prescient decision, since within a few months the peso
            was devalued against the dollar and was followed by a harsh
            depression-level economic crisis throughout 1995. This had a
            tremendous effect on membership in El Barzón, which peaked in 1996
            with approximately 500,000 members (Williams 1996: 5).
          </p>
          <p>
            The El Barzón movement began its ideological campaign by claiming
            that the loan repayment conditions after the collapse of the peso
            were not the fault of the debtors but of the government and the
            banks. The movement further argued that it would be unfair to hold
            the debtors responsible. Its slogan was “Debo, no niego, pago lo
            justo” (“I owe, I don’t deny it, but I’ll pay what is fair”), which
            spoke directly to the anxiety many felt concerning the question of
            justice. Armed with these words, the power of justice was brought to
            the side of the debtor and not the banks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second salient aspect of the movement was its use of the law as
            a tool of aggression. Lawyers attached to the movement filed
            hundreds of thousands of briefs (often with much fanfare) and were
            able to seriously hinder the process of dispossession that the banks
            sped up in the course of the neoliberalization of the financial
            sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third aspect of the movement was its ability to act directly for
            the membership. As Heather Williams writes: “First, it engaged in
            collective civil resistance to police and banks; second, it provided
            movement participants with personal legal assistance; and, third, it
            offered Barzon members professional advice on how to structure their
            businesses or farms to avoid further indebtedness” (Williams 2001:
            182).
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the movement was able to create and carry on a remarkable
            demonstration culture. It raised hell by blockading homes, for
            example, when houses and cars of members were foreclosed on and
            repossessed. It had an intense round of marches, road blockades,
            popular denunciations, invasions of local officials’ offices, and
            even “popular ‘liberation’ of goods that movement participants
            maintained had been repossessed unjustly” (Williams 2001: 189).
          </p>
          <p>
            The movement grew rapidly across the country and was known for both
            its practical approach (by setting up legal consultation services
            for debtors) and riveting tactics. El Barzón members often staged
            demonstrations in front of banks entirely naked or after sewing
            their eyes shut. At times, they sprayed slogans on bank walls with
            syringes filled with what looked like their own blood. The movement
            forced the government to come to the aid of the embattled debtors
            and had a positive impact on the situation of Mexican debtors that
            was proven beyond dispute.
          </p>
          <p>
            The membership of the organization dramatically declined after 1996,
            and a number of apparently divisive changes took place with respect
            to the relationship with political parties, when party members tried
            to get El Barzón to align itself with the party in question. El
            Barzón still exists, but it has largely been marginalized.

          <h3>Queries for Strike Debt</h3>
          <p>
            El Barzón, like many other debt resistors’ movements, was triggered
            by a period of a rapid and substantial increase in the rate of
            indebtedness. The very dimensions of the debt crisis created a sense
            of social unity through collective indebtedness instead of
            decomposition through individual debt. In other words, through
            collectivity the normal shame and individualistic reaction to the
            condition of indebtedness was transcended, and debt revealed itself
            to be a social condition that could be dealt with only in a social
            manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            El Barzón arose when indebtedness could not be explained on a
            case-by-case basis. The peso devaluation clearly was connected with
            the actions of state and bank officials and their plans. El Barzón
            easily convinced millions that asking who would be bailed out would
            not be determined fairly or democratically unless collective action
            was taken.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a situation that applies to the United States since the
            bailout of the “too big to fail” banks and insurance companies
            post-2008. It gives us a window of opportunity to pose vital issues
            while the contrast between the bailout of the 1 percent versus the
            drowning of the 99 percent is still fresh. Can organizations like
            Strike Debt help give a radical outcome to this process before it,
            too, becomes history?
          </p>
          <p>
            We can also learn from El Barzón that debt struggles seem to be
            prone to interclass alliances that give them both great strength and
            weakness. El Barzón’s mixture of small farmers, middle-class urban
            homeowners, and capitalists in “declining” industries found in the
            organization a common point of attraction. As Heather Williams
            writes: “In a capitalist nation shaken to the timbers by prolonged
            economic crisis, the Barzon embodies a paradoxical movement in which
            the politics of the bourgeoisie and the peasantry are radicalized
            while organized labor languishes under the strain of mass
            unemployment and controlled leadership” (Williams 1996: 45). But the
            interclass composition of the movement also remained a source of
            tension, which expressed itself especially in the question of the
            relation with political parties and the state. This is an important
            issue for Strike Debt, but because of the small number of farmers
            (both large and small) in the United States and our lack of
            involvement in small-business profit debt (up until Occupy Sandy),
            we might be able to evade the contradictory forces that came with El
            Barzón and many other debtors’ movements going back to ancient Rome.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a paradox inherent in all debtors’ movements (unless they
            are attached to a wider program of social transformation): the more
            successful the organization, the less attractive it becomes, since
            “the issue” defining it seems to be on the way to being “solved.”
            This is a standard feature of “single-issue” organizing. If we want
            to escape this paradox, we must, like the Zapatistas, set the
            demands at the horizon of social possibility. For example, Strike
            Debt supports a debt-cancellation jubilee (a universal cancellation
            of debt). But there are reformist as well as revolutionary debt
            jubilees. Reformist jubilees relieve the pressure put on ruling
            classes by debtors’ movements, since the jubilee appears to have
            “solved” the problem and then dissipates the mass opposition to
            debt. Debts have been cancelled in these reformist jubilees, so that
            the oppressive machine could keep grinding on. However, some
            jubilees have a revolutionary impact and mark the beginning of new
            forms of social organization. What should Strike Debt be,
            revolutionary or reformist?
          </p>
          <p>
            The victories of debtors’ movements such as El Barzón have been
            indirect but are historically important. They have changed the
            relations of power in society in favor of the debtors. El Barzón was
            able to induce the government and the banks to negotiate the
            condition of the loans. El Barzón was thus able to have an enormous
            effect on the impact of the crisis in Mexico. As James J. Biles
            points out: “Overall, more than five million Mexican households were
            able to renegotiate debts and thousands of properties were saved
            from foreclosure” (Biles 2010: 265). El Barzón was undoubtedly
            responsible for much of this result. Will Strike Debt have a similar
            impact on the balance of forces between proletarian debtors and
            capitalist creditors?
          </p>
          <p>
            We can take guidance in answering these queries from the social
            movements (or “societies in movement,” as Raúl Zibechi describes
            them) in South America in the last two decades (Zibechi 2012). Many
            of these movements have decided to affect the left-wing governments
            there without becoming part of them, that is, to keep a critical
            distance from the state while demanding a reparation of the wealth
            expropriated in the past. In this moment, as Silvia Federici (2012)
            and others have argued, there is no possibility even for the reform
            of capitalism, without keeping a revolutionary horizon open by
            creating territories of commons-based forms of social reproduction.
