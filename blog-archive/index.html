                Strike Debt is a decentralized network of debt resisters,
                including activists, artists, and organizers. Started in New
                York City in 2012, Strike Debt has achieved much since its
                origin: the creation of anti-debt organizations around the US,
                the writing and publication of The Debt Resisters’ Operations
                Manual, and the material support and organizational base for

                In the United States we are finally witnessing a steadily
                increasing backlash against police militarization, murder at the
                hands of police and the general devaluation of Black life. At
                the same time, there is a growing movement against debt in our
                society: the fact that in order to survive — to get ourselves
                basic needs like food, shelter, healthcare and education — we
                are forced to go into debt. It may not be apparent on first
                glance, but there are deep connections between these struggles.

                The Department of Education should be a responsible steward of
                the nation’s colleges and universities. These days it’s acting
                more like a debt collector for a predatory lender. Today’s
                announcement of the sale of 56 Corinthian College campuses to
                Education Credit Management Corporation really drives this fact
                home. As former Everest student Geovanna Nieves noted, &hellip;

                Strike Debt’s Rolling Jubilee project has abolished almost $4
                million in private student debt for a little over $100,000 These

                predatory for-profit institution in the Corinthian Colleges
                network. You can read a sample letter received by debtors here.

                This time, it’s different. Since the beginning of the Rolling
                Jubilee campaign, we&#8217;ve wanted to buy and abolish student
                debt. But most student loans are guaranteed by the federal
                government, and so they are not available for purchase. As part
                of our effort to buy private, unsecured student loans, we talked

                By Strike Debt Carbondale Reposted from Midwest Campus Crisis We
                held a Debtors’ Assembly on April 10 outside of the Student
                Center on Southern Illinois University campus. Inspired by
                Strike Debt, an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street, our only plan
                for the assembly was to come with some personal stories about
                how debt affects our &hellip;

                By Andrew Ross Every other day brings us fresh headlines about
                malfeasance, fraud and continued predatory behavior on the part
                of the finance industry. Morally speaking, bankers are the most
                depraved and derelict actors in our society. And yet they
                continue to rely upon heavy-duty moralism to enforce debtors’
                obligations. What is an appropriate response? &hellip;

                the United States (around 50 million people) will get a
                significant reduction in their access to food because of cuts to
                SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most people
                who rely on SNAP benefits will not be notified ahead of time

                More than ten million foreclosures have piled up nationwide
                since the beginning of the mortgage crisis (Silver-Greenberg),
                forcing untold millions of people out of their homes. Egregious
                but all-too-common corporate practices contributed to the
                disaster: robo-signed or plainly fraudulent paperwork; borrowers
                with prime credit scores receiving subprime loans based on race.

                tuition-free for all students?  Much less than you think.

                Detroit is the epicenter of failed capitalism in America. The
                city has suffered decades of neglect as capital has fled,

                Once again, Congress is talking about how to fix student debt
                without actually talking about student debt or the cost of
                higher education. To date, the negotiations have been focused on
                where to set the interest rate charged to students. It currently
                stands at 3.4% but is set to double on July first to 6.8%.

                Season’s Greetings from Strike Debt! The Rolling Jubilee has
                struck a chord around the country and the world, giving rise to
                a remarkable outpouring of goodwill and support. The fund has
                exceeded our wildest expectations. We set out with the goal of
                raising $50,000 in order to abolish approximately 1 million
                dollars worth of debt. &hellip;

                This is a preliminary report on the economic effects of
                Hurricane Sandy on New York City. The report examines how the
                use of loans as the main form of “aid” to disaster-impacted
                communities is not effective at addressing individual or
                community needs. Further, the use of loans may lead to
                disastrous longer-term economic consequences for the impacted
                communities.
