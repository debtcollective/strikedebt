          <p>
            Some form of this is far and away our most frequently asked
            question.  It&#8217;s often heartbreaking to read the stories of
            despair and frustration that accompany these questions.  These
            stories overwhelmingly affirm the suspicion that crushing debt is
            very rarely the &#8220;fault&#8221; of the debtor &#8211; most
            often, their situation is precipitated by unfortunate circumstances
            far beyond their control, circumstances which could befall any of
            us.
          </p>
          <p>
            So why can&#8217;t we just pick the &#8220;most&#8221; awful
            stories, the most &#8220;deserving&#8221; victims of the debt
            system, and buy <em>their</em> debt?  The answer is twofold:
          </p>
          <p>
            First, as far as we know, this is impossible.  The way the debt
            buying process works is that essentially anonymous accounts are
            bundled together into large portfolios and sold as a whole. Before
            we buy the debt we don’t know whose debt we are purchasing.  In one
            sense, this is a good thing.  Imagine if debtors information (names,
            addresses, phone numbers, SSNs, &#8230;) was made available without
            having to buy the portfolio.  This would be a serious breach of
            privacy. But the reason this is done is not to protect your privacy,
            but something far more banal: debt collectors &#8211; and the firms
            who sell to them &#8211; don&#8217;t <em>care</em> who you are. They
            only care that they&#8217;re making a good investment &#8211; that,
            as a whole, the package they&#8217;re buying will return more than
            they paid for it, even though any individual account might not. So
            debt sellers put together accounts from many sources and wrap them
            all together, so that debt collectors think they&#8217;re buying a
            package that will have enough accounts worth collecting on.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, there is no way to enroll or sign up for the Jubilee.
            In effect, the Rolling Jubilee is a somewhat random act of mutual
            aid.  And that gets to the second reason why we won&#8217;t just
            pick and choose who to buy, even if we could. The Jubilee is meant
            to help individuals, absolutely, but first and foremost it is
            designed to be a campaign to educate the public about a predatory
            system that puts people into debt for basic needs such as food,
            housing, and education. In our view, <em>none</em> of these debts
            are valid &#8211; they accumulate immorally large amounts of fees
            and interest, and are the result of jacked-up original prices that
            should never have existed in the first place, were it not for
            out-of-control debt financing that inflated them to astronomical
            levels.<b><br /> </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, there is simply no way for us to buy <em>all</em> of the
            debt.  The size of the secondary debt market is enormous &#8211;
            estimates vary, but seem to center in the high tens of billions,
            possibly over a hundred billion dollars <em>per year</em>.
             We&#8217;ve raised about $560,000 as of March 14th, 2013, enough to
            buy about 12 million dollars of debt.  So it&#8217;s not simply a
            matter of getting more attention &#8211; we&#8217;d need to grow
            about a hundred thousand times larger to even handle a year&#8217;s
            worth of debt.  As we&#8217;ve always said, Rolling Jubilee is
            <a
              href="/caq-buy-my-debt/www.thenation.com/article/171478/rolling-jubilee-spark-not-solution"
              >&#8220;a spark, not the solution.&#8221;</a
            >
            What we have to do, as a society, is start moving towards a world
            where healthcare, education, and other basic needs are not simply
            profit centers, not line items on a corporate balance sheet.
             Creating that world is the main mission of Strike Debt.

            So, what do we tell people who are in debt <em>right now</em>,
            and write to us asking that we buy <em>their</em> debt?  We are
            unable to give financial or legal advice, but that said, we can
            point you toward people who may be able to help. If you live in New
            York City and meet certain income restrictions, you can contact the
            organization NEDAP,
            <a href="tel:%28212%29%20925-4929" target="_blank">(212) 925-4929</a
            >, between 12 and 2 PM on Tuesdays-Thursdays. Or you can visit
            CLARO:

              >http://www.brooklynvlp.org/<wbr />programs/claro/</a

            They&#8217;re a walk-in clinic that gives out free advice about debt
            collection.

            or
            <a href="http://www.naca.net/" target="_blank">www.naca.net</a> for
            referrals to free or low-cost legal services in your area that might
            be able to help. Please note that the organizations listed on
            <a href="http://lawhelp.org/" target="_blank">lawhelp.org</a> have
            income eligibility guidelines &#8211; check those before you call.
            If you feel comfortable, please share your story on our Tumblr
            &#8211; &#8220;Why Strike Debt?&#8221; &#8211;
            <a href="http://whystrikedebt.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
             Sharing your experience with debt may help others feel less alone,
            and will definitely help build the case that these debts are a
            crushing burden on society, one that must be eliminated by a broad
            debt resistance movement.
