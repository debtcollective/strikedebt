              >Debtors’ Assembly</a
            >
            on April 10 outside of the Student Center on Southern Illinois
            University campus. Inspired by Strike Debt, an offshoot of Occupy
            Wall Street, our only plan for the assembly was to come with some
            personal stories about how debt affects our lives and our visions
            for the future, and to invite others to share their own thoughts on
            these topics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking at the assembly, one organizer confessed that during the
            planning, he found himself at a loss as to what kind of “personal
            story” to share at the assembly.
          </p>
          <p>So he called his mother.</p>
          <p>
            Mom taught literature at a junior high school in rural Illinois for
            more than twenty years. She also raised two kids, with some
            financial help from grandma, a little from dad, and a lot from
            loans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stress, mom said, is inseparable from debt. It weighs you down; you
            feel it in your neck and back. Debt impresses itself onto our lives
            and our bodies through stress. This is one of the ways debt limits
            and controls our actions, thoughts, and desires. It changes us; we
            are less alive because of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The assembly against debt sparked recognition of that disciplinary
            function. We are wrapped in promises that are impossible to keep,
            owing our futures to banks whose power we abhor. The choice seems
            stark. Either we live out our lives as indentured servants, or we
            challenge the very principles that undergird this capitalist
            <a
              href="http://roarmag.org/2014/02/andrew-ross-creditocracy-debt-refusal/"
              target="_blank"
              >creditocracy</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            “For me, what I like about this sort of collection—this collection
            of people that are also indebted—is that I can begin a
            transformation with myself and along with others to receive my debt
            as not a personal source of shame or guilt or embarrassment, but as
            a source of a sort of collective outrage,” said Philip Brewer, a
            graduate student studying philosophy. “I think that’s a really
            important emotion. That we need to be outraged at the creditor class
            that has fundamentally indentured thousands, millions of students.
            Our future has been erased.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The university, an
            <a
              href="http://www.reclamationsjournal.org/blog/?p=596"
              target="_blank"
              >increasingly financialized capitalist institution</a
            >, demands exorbitant tuition dollars from students while it sucks
            surplus value out of its workers. On average, graduate student
            workers at SIU pay more than two months of their salaries back to
            the university in fees. This means that even with a stipend, grad
            students often have to take out loans, promising to work in the
            future as a condition of going to work today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mitchel Morden, who helped coordinate the assembly, said he isn’t as
            directly afflicted by debt because he “sold his soul to Uncle Sam,”
            serving in the military, which paid him. But, Morden said, he
            understands the importance of consciousness-raising and solidarity
            in the face of such a sweeping “systemic problem.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim of the assembly was to create a space in which students
            could concretely understand the systemic problem of debt through
            sharing and listening, while at the same time creating a disruption
            in campus life: a moment when school is interrupted so some real
            learning might begin. Toward the end of our assembly, spirits were
            so high that we decided to do it again next week, and to bring more
            of our friends. Our hope is that a regular, public assembly held
            outdoors will seduce the shy and become a body out of which new
            relationships are formed across ages, disciplines and employments.
          </p>
          <p>
            We think the time is ripe for a new round of student struggles, and
            the issue of debt needs to be front and center. The debt assembly is
            one tactic that we hope will contribute to a movement of students
            and teachers looking to one another, and taking both their lives and
            the university back from a class of creditors, administrators, and
            corporate investors whose capitalist logic has erased the very idea
            of education and foreclosed on our future.
          </p>
