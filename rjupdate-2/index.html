          <p>The Rolling Jubilee team has some big news!</p>
          <p>
            We are very happy to announce that we have completed our second
            purchase of medical debt. This time, we bought and abolished over $1
            million in debt from emergency rooms in Kentucky and Indiana. The
            average debtor owed around $900 and we will be abolishing the debt
            of over 1,000 people! We are sending the letters to the debtors as
            we type this. We are very concerned with the privacy of debtors, but
            if any of them come forward and want to share their stories, we will
            make them public.
          </p>
          <p>
            This will be the second in a series of purchases of medical debt.
            For each one, we will announce it on this blog with extended
            details.<br />
            We’ve also been working long and hard to make sure our finances and
            operations are as transparent as possible. The all-volunteer Board
            of Directors, along with the RJ sub-committees (tech, messaging
            &amp; debt buying) and countless activists throughout the Strike
            Debt and Occupy Wall Street networks have been working diligently to
            ensure the Rolling Jubilee accomplishes its mission with dignity,
            transparency and political effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the beginning of the project over six months ago we have been
            very clear about three things we want from this project: (1) to
            provide some real relief for those around the country who are
            struggling under the crushing burden of debt; (2) to change the
            conversation around debt and austerity; and (3) to help advance debt
            resistance as part of a larger movement capable of bringing about a
            profound transformation of our economic system.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we launched in November we expected to raise $50,000. Instead
            we raised over $500,000. We expected to get some press and
            attention, but we didn&#8217;t expect to get hundreds of interview
            requests and thousands of emails from debtors around the country
            describing their plight. This outpouring of support has moved and
            inspired us.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a focus on transparency and a policy of humble indebtedness to
            our donors, supporters and the public, we decided to release the
            following on our newly launched
            <a href="http://rollingjubilee.org/transparency"
              >transparency page</a
            >:
          </p>

          <p>
            It is our hope that these documents offer some insight into the very
            complicated operations of Rolling Jubilee. (In case you haven’t seen
            it yet, please check out the
            <a href="/taxanalysts/">interview our lawyers did</a> with Tax
            Analysts in February.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Our financial documents will show our transactions over the past few
            months. We decided to put aside 10% of our donations in reserve, and
            have spent some initial money on start-up costs: CPA fees,
            consulting fees, insurance fees, registration paperwork, etc. Going
            forward, we expect these costs to be significantly minimized; most
            of the remaining money will go directly to buying and abolishing
            debt. We still expect to abolish around 20x what we raised: which
            would be nearly $12 million.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are wondering why we have not spent all of the funds we
            raised on debt yet, fear not. We are proceeding with care and
            caution, and more announcements will be made and actions planned in
            the coming months. A significant amount of due diligence must be
            done on each portfolio and we are weighing our options carefully. We
            think it’s more important to spend donations well&#8211;on debts
            that will actually help people&#8211;than spend them quickly. Each
            portfolio of debt we buy also provides an opportunity for public
            education and political momentum, and we hope to use these
            opportunities as wisely as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            When starting Rolling Jubilee we committed to buying medical debt
            first and foremost, wanting to call attention to the profound
            inhumanity and inequity of our for-profit healthcare system. We have
            spent a great deal of time learning about the medical debt market,
            and the healthcare industry at large. It is an industry designed to
            confuse, overwhelm, and exploit. Though one in three people have
            medical debt, very few know that their debts are for sale on the
            secondary market, nor do they realize that old medical bills can
            negatively impact their credit scores, often with disastrous
            consequences for their financial well being. Even some people in the
            industry agree that medical debt should not exist (and of course
            it doesn&#8217;t in most industrialized countries). It’s also hard
            to purchase. Unlike credit card or payday loan debt, it is usually
            sold by hospitals and practitioners to local debt collectors,
            sometimes in bundles or by physicians groups. Because we don’t want
            our purchases limited to New York, we have to work locally and
            regionally rather than in the national market. This means building
            relationships, one at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are thrilled to be helping so many people. But we are not naive.
            We know this won’t fix a broken and unjust system. Our health care
            industry reflects all that is wrong with the world today: a basic
            right (the right to take care and be taken care of) has become a
            commodity. People are made to suffer twice, first from injury or
            illness and then financial extortion. We are all forced into debt
            while private insurance companies, banks and real estate moguls
            profit off of our misery. We refuse to accept this. We want to use
            the attention these buys will generate to have an impact on the
            struggle for real, free, accessible healthcare for the 99%. There
            are real solutions being proposed as alternatives to Obama’s
            Affordable Care Act: a single-payer healthcare system would save the
            U.S. $400 billion dollars every year; even just expanding Medicare
            to all would save $68 billion by 2020. Creating a public alternative
            or single-payer system are some of the many ways to strike debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have been working for months with allies and activists in the
            healthcare industry, and
