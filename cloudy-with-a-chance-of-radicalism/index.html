            >), among other groups, is fighting to push it through, against
            pressure from big banks and big government alike. But there’s a new
            twist on the concept of using eminent domain that could have far
            wider implications, not only for the foreclosure crisis, but also
            for the power of big banks. In this post we explore that
            twist—referred to here as “clouded chain of title”—and its potential
            implications.
          </p>
          <p>
            By this point, many of us have at least heard of mortgage-backed
            securities and other financial products that gambled on future
            mortgage payments and lost, precipitating the 2008 financial crisis
            and throwing hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people out
            of their homes via foreclosure. Most of the gamblers (big banks,
            other financial institutions) have yet to pay for their bad bets,
            while homeowners and former homeowners—perhaps better understood as
            “debt-owners”—continue to struggle in the wake of Wall Street’s
            failures. A situation known as “broken” or “clouded” chain of
            title—a lesser-known aspect of the mortgage-backed securities
            story—may hold the potential to turn this around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Put simply, in order for mortgages to become part of a financial
            instrument—to become “securitized”—they need to be pooled with other
            mortgages and then transferred from the originator (Bank of America,
            Countrywide, or whoever issued the original mortgage), to an
            aggregator, eventually ending up in a securitized trust for
            investors. For our purposes, the finer details are unimportant. What
            <i>is</i> important is that each of these steps requires a true and
            legal sale from one entity to the next.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last step in this sequence—when the mortgage joins a securitized
            trust—is documented by a Pooling and Servicing Agreement (PSA).<b
            > </b>Each PSA has a cutoff date, and if the mortgages are not
            transferred into the PSA by the cutoff date, then that sale is not
            true and legal. (According to one of the lawyers we consulted for
            this article, the more accurate language is “a post-cutoff-date
            transfer is a void assignment,” taken from the court case
            <a
              title="Glaski v. Bank of America"
              href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8535344425094007526&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"
              target="_blank"
              ><i>Glaski v</i><i>. Bank of America</i></a
            >.) Missing the cutoff date for transfer into the PSA clouds the
            chain of title on the mortgage<i>, </i>meaning that the official
            record of ownership of a given mortgage is now muddled, throwing
            into question <i>who owns that mortgage</i>. The bank that receives
            your monthly payments doesn’t own the mortgage, since the bank is
            merely a “servicer” for the investors. The aggregator may or may not
            still own it, given that the aggregator received money from the
            trust it was ultimately placed in, and from that point on assumed
            that the mortgage was legally no longer in its possession. But the
            investors don’t really own it either, because it wasn’t transferred
            into the PSA before the cutoff date.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this clouded chain of title situation may seem obscure and
            technical, it turns out that when the mortgage-backed securities
            market started heating up around 2005, and even before, an unknown
            but very high percentage of mortgages that were turned into
            mortgage-backed securities were transferred into their PSAs
            <i>after</i> the cutoff date. One industry insider told us that
            <i
              >all non-Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgages were transferred
              improperly</i
            >. In other words, the ownership of potentially millions of
            mortgages is in question.

            <p>
              What does this have to do with systemic solutions to the ongoing
              foreclosure crisis and eminent domain? Put simply, if we can
              combine the eminent domain strategy that Richmond is currently
              contemplating with legal proceedings that force banks/trusts to
              prove that they own mortgages in their portfolios (which they
              can’t, because they don’t, as described above), we have the
              potential to wrest untold thousands of mortgages out of the hands
              of Wall Street. What we then do with them (and who might own them
              if not the banks or the trust) is another question. But first
              things first: what does this plan look like?
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is the idea laid out in five steps, using Richmond as a
              hypothetical example:
            </p>
            <p>
              Step 1: Find a willing Richmond citizen whose mortgage is in
              dispute. This will be easy given that, by insider estimations,
              after 2005 all non-Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgages were
              transferred improperly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Step 2: The city of Richmond steps in on behalf of this citizen,
              in an attempt to force banks (acting on behalf of the trust) to
              prove ownership of the mortgage. The city has at least two choices
              here: One, as a preliminary step before going ahead with the
              eminent domain seizure of this citizen’s mortgage, Richmond can
              ask a judge to determine ownership of the mortgage using something
              called “declaratory judgment law” (for legal folks out there, this
              is Cal. Civ. Proc. Section 1060). Put simply,
              <a
                title="Declaratory judgement – Wikipedia"
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaratory_judgment"
                target="_blank"
                >declaratory judgment law</a
              >
              asks the court to resolve a legal uncertainty. In this case, the
              uncertainty is, <i>who owns this mortgage?</i> In the declaratory
              judgment suit, the city would note that it is planning to condemn
              the loan via eminent domain, but due to an apparently invalid
              assignment process, the “owner” of the mortgage is unclear. Thus
              the lawsuit would determine ownership of the mortgage. A second
              approach might be for the city to condemn the loan as abandoned
              property.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, pay close attention because this is the important part:
              <i
                >In either strategy, the bank will come forward to challenge the
                city, declaring itself (acting on behalf of the trust) to be the
                owner. This means that in clouded title processes—unlike the
                current Richmond plan or extant court cases like </i
              >Glaski v. Bank of America<i
                >—the burden of proof should rest with the trusts, and with the
                banks working as their trustees, to show that they are actually
                the party with rights to the loan.<b> </b></i
              >In other words, this kind of eminent domain approach could force
              trusts and the banks through which they work to acknowledge that,
              in fact, they <i>do not own</i> hundreds of thousands of mortgages
              they claim to own.
            </p>
            <p>
              Legally speaking, Step 2 is complicated. But let’s say for the
              sake of argument that the judge indeed decides that the clouded
              chain of title or “void assignment” means that the trust does not
              actually own the mortgage, which is the legal precedent we are
              trying to create. This leads us to…

            <p>
              Step 3: If the trust doesn’t own the mortgage, the next legal
              question is, <i>well who does? </i>The city is making a claim on
              the mortgage via eminent domain, but it still has to offer the
              owner, whoever that may be, fair market value (FMV) in order to
              take possession.<sup><a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">1</a></sup>
              Most lawyers we’ve spoken with say that once it has been
              established that the trust does not own the loan, ownership would
              revert back one step in the chain, to the aggregator or maybe the
              loan originator.<sup><a id="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">2</a></sup>
              Seems straightforward enough, except that in California and across
              the country, many of those companies went out of business entirely
              (see a list of
              <a
                title="Mortgage Lender Implode-O-Meter"
                href="http://ml-implode.com/fulllist.html#lists"
                target="_blank"
                >388 such companies here</a
              >) and left no successors.<sup
                ><a id="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">3</a></sup
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              If it turns out that there <i>is </i>an owner, whether the
              aggregator or the mortgage originator, we’re back to using eminent
              domain, as Richmond originally envisioned (i.e.,
              <a
                title="Richmond CARES"
                href="http://richmondcares.com/"
                target="_blank"
                >the CARES program</a
              >, albeit for a single mortgage). It seems predictable enough that
              whoever has been declared the owner (some sort of entity tied to
              Wall Street) will push the same kind of court case
              <a
                title='"Judge says premature to rule on Calif. eminent domain lawsuit" – Reuters'
                href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/12/us-usa-mortgages-richmond-idUSBRE98B14T20130912"
                target="_blank"
                >that has already been filed in Richmond</a
              >,<sup><a id="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">4</a></sup> even if said
              entity is already bankrupt. It also seems safe to assume that
              every bank in America will be falling over themselves to pay all
              associated court costs and we’ll be potentially looking at years
              of litigation. But even anticipating this response, we will have
              already dealt Wall Street a nasty blow—legal proof that the tens
              of thousands of trusts that were set up to hold securitized
              mortgages don’t really own them!
            </p>
            <p>
              And if no one owns the loan, we move on to Step 4, where things
              start to get very exciting and <i>very </i>speculative.
            </p>
            <p>
              Step 4: With no owner, it seems there is a <i>chance</i> that the
              city would not have to offer FMV to anyone. In terms of legal
              procedure, the city could then hold the proceeds of the loan in
              escrow, and pursue a
              <a
                title="Quiet title – Wikipedia"
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet_title"
                target="_blank"
                >quiet title</a
              >
              action: after five years, if ownership on the loan proceeds is
              still unknown, quiet title could proceed via an “unclaimed funds”
              argument, and those funds could then legally belong to the city.
            </p>
            <p>
              Step 5: Once the precedent is established that the city can take
              possession of mortgages via clouded title/eminent domain, there
              are many possible routes that Richmond could take. Among them, the
              city could threaten to initiate the same procedure against a whole
              set of houses within Richmond, unless the servicers/banks/trusts
              negotiate satisfactory principal reductions. Another option would
              be to forego the threat and instead simply take those mortgages
              and place them in another entity altogether. For instance, (and to
              end with a provocation) this would be an ideal situation to
              leverage in order to argue for a
              <a
                title="Public Banking Institute"
                href="http://publicbankinginstitute.org/"
                target="_blank"
                >public bank</a
              >. Rather than give those mortgages over to another private
              company to securitize and gamble with all over again, the city
              could set up a public bank to service those mortgages, collect
              payments, etc. Leveraging clouded title to set up public banks has
              the potential not only to eliminate the blight caused by the
              foreclosure crisis, but also to use the funds collected to invest
              in public infrastructure—schools, roads, parks—instead of
              providing profits to Wall Street and shareholders, as is the
              mandate of private banks.<sup
                ><a id="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">5</a></sup
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              As this brief mention of a public bank suggests, this new twist on
              the eminent domain tactic has exciting implications. Not least
              among these is the prospect of finally transferring some of those
              ill-gotten gains away from the gamblers, who have yet to be
              punished in any meaningful way for their recklessness with other
              people’s money, and toward today’s debt-owners, who once imagined
              themselves to be homeowners. Even if the plan fails, it still has
              the potential to cause serious tax problems for these trusts.
              Proof that mortgages were entered into PSAs past the closing date
              would theoretically eliminate the tax-exempt status (as
              pass-through entities) that trusts currently enjoy.<sup
                ><a id="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6">6</a></sup
              >
              To date, the IRS doesn’t seem to care, and no one seems to have
              pushed the issue, but suppose some “outraged taxpayers”
              <a
                title="Whistleblower Informant Award"
                href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Whistleblower-Informant-Award"

                >reported a set of trusts as tax cheats</a
              >
              and demanded that the IRS pursue them and give the group the 30%
              of the taxes and penalties recovered that would be their due!
            </p>
            <p>
              While the clouded title approach has many legal complexities, and
              while it is very difficult to tell what might happen once a brave
              municipality decides to test the waters, we feel confident
              asserting two things: First, simply the prospect of turning the
              tables on the banks by forcing them to prove ownership (which they
              most likely cannot) is itself a significant step in the right
              direction. Second, as one lawyer we consulted for this article put
              it:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                These are issues of power. Create enough political leverage, and
                these nebulous and complex issues get resolved in favor of the
                people. Judges and policymakers have to understand that correct
                decisions are the only thing standing between them and 40,000
                people marching in the street.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              And for that reason, we introduce these issues to you, so that you
              can introduce them to your friends, and if they hit the courts, we
              can all be ready. See you in the streets.

                  would get control of it and make the decision about whether to
