            The Rolling Jubilee was developed in consultation with a legal team
            who recently did an interview with
            <a href="http://www.taxanalysts.com/">Tax Analysts</a>, a news
            website for tax professionals. David S. Miller has been ranked the
            top tax lawyer in the United States for the seven consecutive years
            by the United States Lawyer Rankings. He is considered one of
            &#8220;The World&#8217;s Leading Lawyers&#8221; by Chambers Global
            and his name appears on the list of &#8220;The Best Lawyers in
            America&#8221; and &#8220;The Legal 500&#8221; (see his full bio

                <span style="font-size: medium;"
                  >A volunteer-led organization that has raised hundreds of
                  thousands of dollars to buy and pay off medical debts as a
                  gift to debtors says it intends to seek IRS recognition as a
                  section 501(c)(4) tax-exempt organization.</span

                  >The Rolling Jubilee Fund works to educate the public about
                  consumer credit &#8212; how and when it is advanced, how it is
                  bought and sold, and how it&#8217;s collected, three attorneys
                  representing the fund on a pro bono basis told Tax Analysts.
                  The fund also furthers social welfare by helping patients with
                  outstanding medical debt, the attorneys said.</span

                  to relieve the burdens of the sick,&#8221; the attorneys said.
                  &#8220;And hundreds of tax-exempt organizations educate the
                  public about debt and how to relieve debt. We are not aware of
                  any organization that has combined these two objectives in
                  exactly the way that Rolling Jubilee does, but we don&#8217;t
                  believe that there is any reason such a combination should not
                  be considered an exempt purpose that promotes social
                  welfare.&#8221;</span

                  application, and no conversations about it have taken place
                  with IRS officials, the attorneys said. Rolling Jubilee is run
                  by volunteers, many of whom were involved in the Occupy Wall
                  Street movement and face debt burdens themselves, the
                  attorneys said.</span

                  Law LLC, whose practice focuses on entertainment and small
                  business law, and Margaret Ratner Kunstler, a civil rights

                  been raised to retire more than $11 million in debt, but the
                  attorneys said the organization has so far bought and forgiven
                  $100,000 in debt. (See </span

                  pay them all off, that debt can be bought for pennies on the
                  dollar, the lawyers said. The fund is doing that and forgiving
                  the debt to educate the country about the debt market, the
                  lawyers said, adding that the fund may later acquire

                  Rolling Jubilee is &#8220;an interesting concept,&#8221; and
                  the fund&#8217;s stated goal of educating the public about
                  Americans going bankrupt when they get sick seems well
                  targeted at boosting the country&#8217;s social welfare, said
                  Ofer Lion of Hunton &amp; Williams LLP. That, he said, is an
                  exempt purpose for a 501(c)(4) organization.</span

                  >Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer of the University of Notre Dame Law
                  School said there&#8217;s &#8220;at least a reasonably strong
                  argument&#8221; for why the Rolling Jubilee effort generally
                  furthers an exempt purpose. There are two elements of the
                  argument, and the first is that standards for 501(c)(4)
                  organizations are looser than those for 501(c)(3) groups,
                  Mayer said.</span

                <span style="font-size: medium;"
                  >&#8220;The second thing is I think you could argue that while
                  it&#8217;s true they don&#8217;t do means testing of the
                  people that benefit from this because it&#8217;s practically
                  impossible, the debt they&#8217;re buying is highly distressed
                  debt,&#8221; Mayer said.</span

              <p>
                <span style="font-size: medium;"
                  >According to Mayer, that could mean that most people holding
                  that debt are in a precarious financial position; otherwise,
                  the debt wouldn&#8217;t be available for purchase at such
                  discounts. The same may not be true with other types of debt,
                  he said.</span

                  >&#8220;Mortgages I think are actually a little bit of a
                  harder case because you have someone who is pretty well off,
                  but their house is underwater and maybe the foreclosure
                  process is difficult, and so the debt is being discounted not
                  because the individuals are particularly bad off financially,
                  but just because your chance of actually collecting on the
                  debt is relatively small,&#8221; Mayer said.</span

                  Miller, Kunstler, and Hrbek told Tax Analysts that forgiveness
                  of the debt does not result in income to the debtor if that
                  forgiveness comes from a detached and disinterested
                  generosity. Lion said these debtors seem to have a good case
                  that they&#8217;re receiving an exempt gift rather than a
                  taxable gain.</span

                  >Mayer agreed, saying the debt forgiveness counts as a gift
                  under section 102. He said that when Rolling Jubilee buys the
                  debt, it doesn&#8217;t know who the beneficiaries are but
                  discharges the debt purely out of a desire to benefit those
                  who incurred it.</span

                  disinterested as you can get,&#8221; Mayer said. &#8220;The
                  one weird thing is usually you don&#8217;t think of entities
                  being detached and disinterested givers &#8212; you just think
                  of individuals.&#8221;</span

                  >Robert Willens of Robert Willens LLC said he believes the IRS
                  would resist the characterization of these cancellations of
                  debt as gifts but that they&#8217;ll &#8220;get lost&#8221; in
                  the reporting process anyway.</span

                  this, there won&#8217;t be much enforcement on their
                  part,&#8221; Willens said. &#8220;That&#8217;s not the way we
                  like to do tax planning, but I guess it could
                  work.&#8221;</span

                  regarding any aspect of the Rolling Jubilee program. Unless
                  the dollar volume grows higher or there&#8217;s an indication
                  of someone with Rolling Jubilee personally profiting, it
                  won&#8217;t be a high priority for the IRS, he said.</span

                  at minimum to audit the 990, and they may or may not bother to
                  do so depending on their other priorities.&#8221;</span
