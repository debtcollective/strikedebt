          <p><strong>Why does it take so long to buy debt?</strong></p>
          <p>
            The purchase of each debt portfolio can take weeks or months to
            complete, as the debt-buying industry is incredibly complex. We are
            taking time to learn the ins and outs of the market so that we can
            spend the money most effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            The debt-buying world is a shadowy, speculative market where
            delinquent and charged-off debts are bundled into large portfolios
            and sold as a whole for pennies on the dollar. It is largely
            unregulated and filled with shady characters, many of whom are
            actively trying to rip each other off. We are taking care to be sure
            that we aren’t taken advantage of, that our deals are good, and at
            market value. We think it&#8217;s far more important to be certain
            that we spend your donations accurately, on real debts that help
            real people, than quickly, on debts of dubious nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, we want all of our debt buys to be strategic and
            effective. We want to buy debt that will provide the most mutual aid
            possible and debt that will highlight specific injustices within our
            economy. Currently, we are focusing on medical debt in order to call
            attention to the profound inhumanity and inequality in our
            healthcare system. Medical debt, however, is particularly difficult
            to purchase; unlike credit card and payday loan debt, it is usually
            sold to local debt collectors. Because we don’t want our purchases
            limited to New York, this means working locally and regionally
            rather than in the national market. The debt industry is also a
            surprisingly small world, based on personal relationships. We are
            working to build those relationships, but it takes time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are also taking care not to buy bad debt—debt that is considered
            uncollectable. Bad debts have already done their damage, whereas
            newer debts that still might be collected have not. Because of this,
            newer debts more effectively maximize mutual aid. In order to be
            sure our purchases are effective, a significant amount of due
            diligence must be done on each portfolio. This can be quite involved
            and includes running a variety of reports and asking numerous
            follow-up questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are fully committed to transparency and will always post
            information about each purchase as soon as our lawyers finish
            reviewing the documents and our privacy committee has ensured that
            the debtors’ identifying information has been removed. Additionally,
            we are hiring a CPA and plan to announce our financial reporting
            policy in March. Currently, our first purchase, completed November
            12th, is documented on our website. Our next purchase is well
            underway and should be completed and announced in mid-March.
          </p>
