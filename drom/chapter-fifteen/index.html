        <!--<article  id="post-">-->

        <article class="content">
          <p>
            The chapters of this manual highlight the inherent injustice of the
            kinds of debt that afflict most people living in the United States
            and around the world today, and provide some advice about what to do
            about them. If anything should be clear by now, it’s that all of
            these forms of debt are connected. They didn’t all just somehow
            happen. This is a system that’s been built to keep money flowing
            from our pockets into those of Wall Street, corporations, and
            creditors, with the hope that we won’t do anything about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being in debt can be isolating and demoralizing. Understanding the
            debt system holistically is just the first step toward collectively
            envisioning and enacting its abolition. The reason you have tens of
            thousands of dollars in medical bills is that we don’t provide
            medical care to everyone. The reason you have tens of thousands of
            dollars of student loans is because the government, banks, and
            university administrators have contrived to cut government subsidies
            that support education while driving college costs through the roof.
            Unlike fifty years ago, it’s simply impossible for all but the
            wealthiest to attend college without them. Bubbles drive housing and
            food prices up, wages are kept artificially low so that they don’t
            keep up with inflation, and more and more of us rely on
            proliferating forms of “casual,” “flexible,” and part-time
            employment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment we can make these connections in our own lives, we can
            stop being ashamed and start getting angry—and most of all, we can
            turn our outrage into action. Any way that you are able to fight
            back is important. But what those running and benefitting from the
            debt system are really afraid of is that a large number of us might
            start to join together. That’s why it’s so important to them that
            debtors feel ashamed and alone. Because they know that by keeping us
            isolated, we have no power. They also know that the moment large
            numbers of debtors start talking to each other, joining forces, and
            fighting back—they’re in big trouble. The whole system is built on
            the assumption that we won’t.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is strength in numbers. Individually, our debts overwhelm us;
            collectively, a debt resistance movement can overwhelm the system.
            We are not looking for debt “forgiveness” because we didn’t do
            anything wrong. We seek the abolition of debt profiteering and the
            creation of a new financial system, a new economy, and a new way of
            life based on justice, self-determination, and concern for the
            common good.
          </p>
          <h2 class="submenu">Looking Backward</h2>
          <p>
            Movements for debt resistance have a very long history. From ancient
            times, people have challenged the harsh penalties visited on
            defaulters, including branding, torture, imprisonment, and even
            slavery. In ancient Athens, the first known democratic constitution
            came about largely as a result of an outright rebellion of debtors
            (who, at that time, were primarily male heads of household) outraged
            at seeing their wives and children seized and carried off in chains
            to slavery.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the United States, imprisonment for debt was common here well
            after the War of Independence (two signers of the Declaration of
            Independence themselves later ended up imprisoned for debt!). The
            1780s saw a huge wave of foreclosures and debt imprisonments. There
            were various forms of debt resistance at this time, with the most
            dramatic being Shays’s Rebellion, a group of veterans who banded
            together to stop foreclosures. It took many campaigns and
            mobilizations throughout the first half of the nineteenth century to
            abolish debtors’ prisons (though people are still incarcerated
            because of debt—see
            <a
              title="Chapter Nine. Debt Collection: Don’t Feed the Vultures"
              href="/drom/chapter-nine/"
              target="_blank"
              ><i>Chapter Nine</i></a
            >). After the Civil War, there were outright insurrections waged by
            small farmers being foreclosed upon against the “Trusts” that were
            the ancestors of giant U.S. corporations.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the 1920s, there was an expansion of credit and rampant
            speculation that led to the 1929 Stock Market Crash. The ensuing
            Great Depression made the consequences of extreme inequality and
            unchecked capitalist exploitation clear. The limits of capitalism
            and the possibilities for alternative ways of organizing society
            were deeply felt. People banded together to block home evictions and
            farm foreclosures, workers organized their own credit and mutual aid
            associations, labor unions were a force to be reckoned with, and the
            Communist Party couldn’t be denied as a genuine political presence.
            As a desperate move to shore up faltering confidence in a capitalist
            system, politicians brokered a compromise between an insurgent left
            and a nervous capitalist class in the form of the New Deal. The new
            rights and services established under this compromise provided a
            baseline of respect for human life and some modicum of dignity for
            many Americans, but they were systematically denied to Black people,
            who were not considered to be among those worthy of receiving them.
            The state and the banks largely took over the job of organizing
            pensions (social security), mortgages (Fannie Mae), university
            education (the GI Bill) and, in the 1960s, health care (Medicare).
          </p>
          <p>
            During a series of financial crises in the 1970s, business and
            financial interests took advantage of workers’ weakened position to
            reassert their power and begin a decades-long walk-back of this
            postwar compromise. Overall, the defunding of government programs
            and the long decline of labor unions resulted in a massive increase
            of debt and suffering, and economic inequality has once again
            returned to the extraordinary heights of pre-Depression days. And
            yet, despite the capitalist classes’ shredding of this tacit social
            contract, we’re just now seeing the first glimmers of a people’s
            movement here in the United States that demands the space to imagine
            and experiment with postcapitalist ways of life and rejects the debt
            system that disciplines us. Thankfully, there’s much inspiration to
            be found in movements for economic justice across the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Debt resistance movements have cropped up just about everywhere
            across the planet. The Global Justice Movement that emerged in much
            of the global South in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s was a broad
            constellation of social struggles against paying “odious” national
            debts (that is, debt for things no person or country should have had
            to pay for to begin with) to international banks. In many ways, it
            was brilliantly successful, forcing banks—both private lenders and
            institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund—to
            renegotiate the loans by cutting their interest rates, reducing the
            principal, and, in some cases, simply canceling loans outright.
          </p>
          <p>
            There have also been some remarkable struggles against personal debt
            during those same years, like the movement of <em>El Barzón</em> in
            Mexico. In 1994, the Mexican peso dramatically lost value compared
            to the U.S. dollar, which set off a steep inflation that increased
            the interest on variable-rate loans and often made loans, including
            mortgages, that were denominated in U.S. dollars ten times larger.
            This brought nearly 30% of the people indebted to banks into default
            (Williams 1996). The <em>El Barzón</em> movement began by claiming
            that the loan repayment conditions after the collapse of the peso
            were the fault of the government and the banks, and that it would be
            unfair to hold the debtor responsible. Their slogan was, “<i
              >Debo, no niego, pago lo justo</i
            >” (“I owe, I don’t deny it, I’ll pay what is fair”). The movement
            grew rapidly across the country and was known both for its practical
            approach (by setting up legal consultation services for debtors) and
            its riveting tactics. It forced the government to come to the aid of
            the embattled debtors and had a definitive, positive impact on their
            situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, the battle is far from being won. In 2008, the world’s
            poorest countries were paying
            <a

              target="_blank"
              >$23 million a day in interest payments</a
            >
            to the rich industrial world, for loans where the original principal
            had often already been paid back several times over. For much of the
            1990s and 2000s, one of the most popular refrains was that the real
            solution for “Third World poverty” was not less debt but more. Hence
            the craze for “microfinance,” the practice of making small cash
            loans without collateral to rural women as well as the urban poor.
            For a while, this new model swept the world, as it seemed to provide
            a magic bullet out of poverty. But as time went on, it became clear
            these microcredit banks weren’t charities; they charged interest and
            were followed by other banks charging even higher rates of interest.
            Intense shaming and repossessions began, and in recent years, India
            and Bangladesh have seen a mass wave of suicides of “beneficiaries”
            of microcredit loans unable to face the disgrace of inability to
            pay. There have been popular movements that have risen up to fight
            microcredit. <em>Mujeres Creando</em> (Women Creating) is a Bolivian
            anarcha-feminist collective that participates in a range of
            anti-poverty work, including propaganda, street theater, publishing,
            radio programming, and direct action. In 2001, they occupied the
            Bolivian Banking Supervisory Agency on behalf of people indebted to
            microcredit agencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <em>Mujeres</em> also helped a group called
            <em>Deudora</em> (Debtor)—made up largely of poor women from the
            barrios—infiltrate a special luncheon attended by the Banking
            Supervisory Agency’s Superintendent and microcredit lenders. They
            took the opportunity to sing and shout about their suffering and
            denounce the bankers in front of several television cameras. After
            three-and-a-half months of near-daily protests, the
            <em>Mujeres</em> and <em>Deudora</em> managed to sit down with the
            large banking and financial associations and reach an agreement
            whereby the debtors whose houses were being auctioned would

          <h2 class="submenu">The Resistance Is Growing</h2>
          <p>
            Changing the financial system may seem wildly ambitious, but in
            fact, financial systems change all the time. The question is whether
            it will change for the better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anti-debt movements exist and they’re growing stronger. Around the
            world, popular movements are beginning to rattle the chains, seeing
            debt for what it is—a form of domination and exploitation—and
            collectively rising up against it. From Chile to Québec, students
            have challenged the bondage of educational debt traceable to
            cutbacks and privatization and scored major victories. In Greece,
            Spain, and now Italy, we’re seeing veritable uprisings against
            governments demanding austerity so that tax money can flow
            exclusively to foreign bondholders. These movements are growing ever
            more effective. And governments have been forced to backtrack.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s important to note that when these movements win, it’s almost
            never by lobbying the politicians or playing the games of the
            creditor class. We’ll never win so long as those in power make up
            the rules and so long as we concede to them. The aim is not just to
            cancel debts but to fight the conditions and values that got us into
            debt in the first place. And increasingly, people are starting to
            realize that the way to do that is not to ask for anything, but to
            start creating new institutions of our own by which we can
            collectively provide for our needs. Bankers and politicians are
            frightened by direct challenges to power that would render them
            irrelevant.
          </p>
          <p>
            As our movement gets stronger, we can be sure the politicians will
            make concessions that undermine substantial change. We’ve already
            seen a little of this in the United States. The Obama administration
            has set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and has begun
            talking about tinkering with the student loan system. But—inadequate
            as these measures may be—the Obama administration never would have
            done any of this were it not for the growing wave of defaults and
            increasing signs of organized debt resistance. In the end, as was
            the case with the New Deal, the aim of reform is not primarily to
            help people, but to preserve the existing structure of power. This
            doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t fight the government on its own terms
            (for example, by opposing cuts to social programs or further tax
            cuts for the rich). But we’ve seen over and over again that the only
            way to make the government and the elite take notice is to set our
            own terms, by being clear about what values matter to us—health,
            housing, education, our environment, and our relationships.
          </p>
          <h2 class="submenu">How Do We Strike Debt?</h2>
          <p>
            Strike Debt, an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street, emerged out of a
            series of open assemblies in the spring of 2012 with the aim of
            sparking conversations about debt as a global system of domination
            and exploitation. Debt resistance can take many forms, and Strike
            Debt is developing tactics, resources, and frameworks for
            generalizing the fight against the debt system. Underlying all of
            Strike Debt’s projects—from this manual to the Rolling Jubilee to
            various direct actions and examples of mutual aid—is support for a
            jubilee: a full cancellation of all debts. The cancellation of debts
            is not a new notion, but rather one that is deeply rooted in many
            faith traditions including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
            Historically, civilization after civilization has recognized that
            when debt gets unmanageable, it must be cancelled. And jubilees
            still work today. For example, there was a kind of jubilee in
            Iceland after the 2008 economic crisis: instead of bailing out their
            banks, Iceland canceled a percentage of mortgage debt (see<i>
              <a

                >Chapter Thirteen</a
              ></i
            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            To promote this concept and raise awareness about how the wealthy
            profit from our indebtedness, Strike Debt launched the Rolling
            Jubilee in November of 2012, and it has been our most visible
            project so far. Strike Debt raised over $600,000 from thousands of
            individual donors, many deeply indebted themselves, to purchase
            defaulted debt for pennies on the dollar and keep it out of the
            hands of collectors. We have entered this market not to make a
            profit but to help people by abolishing $15 million worth of debt
            all over the country to date, while highlighting how the debt system
            preys on our families and communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the manual you are reading, the Rolling Jubilee was designed to
            expose and undermine the ways that debt works. Few people realize
            that their debts are sold on shadowy markets to speculators hoping
            to cash in on suffering and misfortune. The Rolling Jubilee effort
            was never intended to be a solution to the debt crisis. Strike Debt
            recognizes that the impact of debt cancellation, even on a mass
            scale, would be negligible unless it was coupled with a far deeper
            restructuring of our economic system. We need a jubilee <i>and</i> a
            total transformation of the current financial paradigm. We need a
            final jubilee to end the need for jubilees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Debt resistance is not the final goal of the movement; it is just a
            beginning. We must ensure that these new structures sustain the
            environment that has always sustained us. What will these structures
            look like? How will we build them? We do not have all the answers,
            but the questions have to be asked. Traditionally, alternative
            economies have focused on local forms of mutual aid that operate
            under and within capitalism. While these models are desirable, it
            will be important for us to increase their breadth and scale if we
            are to challenge and eventually replace our failed economic system.
            Our values will serve as our North Star: putting people and nature
            before profits; meeting need and not greed; empowering all and not
            just a few; becoming less alienated from our work and from each
            other; and creating more leisure time to spend with our loved ones.
            As the content of this manual has demonstrated, another world is
            both possible and necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Small-scale examples already abound. Community-supported agriculture
            is a growing alternative to the industrial food system. Community
            land trusts offer a model of affordable housing that prevents
            foreclosures of homes and property speculation. “Really, Really Free
            Markets” based on fair trade are dedicated to sharing resources on
            the basis of a gift economy in which the exchange of used furniture
            and clothing, childcare, and skilled labor are just a few examples.
            Employee-owned companies and worker-controlled, democratically run
            cooperatives are flourishing. To support these endeavors we need a
            new banking system that offers non-exploitative forms of credit and
            that is run for the benefit of all, not just the lenders who extract
            income from loans, investments, and rent. We must remember that as
            part of the ongoing bailout of the financial sector, billions if not
            trillions of dollars of loans were handed out at 0% interest,
            millions of dollars of which ended up as Wall Street bonuses. One of
            many possible solutions worth investigating is public banking (see<i>

                >Chapter Twelve</a

            initiatives and communal enterprises.
          </p>
          <p>
            What other forms can debt resistance take? That is something we need
            to figure out together. We must work to understand the intricacies
            of our debt-driven economy. We also need to listen to and learn from
            the people around us so we can understand how debt affects our lives
            in both similar and uneven ways, paying keen attention to the ways
            that it intersects with factors like race, gender, age, ability,
            nationality, and so on. As we have seen, predatory lending, from
            subprime mortgages to payday loans to for-profit colleges,
            disproportionately impact low-income communities and communities of
            color. The issue of debt also affects us as workers, connecting this
            movement to fights for higher wages and better benefits. Debt
            resistance also dovetails with broader struggles for racial equality
            and economic justice, and we need to make these connections more
            visible and powerful.
          </p>
          <p>
            For now, there are countless ways to “strike” debt: demanding a
            people’s bailout and an end to corporate welfare; collectively
            refusing to pay illegitimate loans; targeting and shutting down
            collections agencies, payday lenders, or for-profit colleges;
            regulating loan speculators out of business; reinstating limits on
            usurious interest rates; defending foreclosed homes; fighting
            tuition hikes and school budget cuts; resisting austerity policies;
            fighting militarism, which accounts for half of our nation’s
            discretionary spending; organizing debtors’ associations and unions;
            and more. On the constructive side, building an alternative economy
            run for mutual benefit is a long-term goal. To get there we must
            experiment with everything from education, counseling, direct
            action, financial civil disobedience, and, importantly, building
            relationships among ourselves to create broad social movements. Debt
            resistance needs to spread far and wide and be adapted to different
            contexts and communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast to the recklessness and manipulation by the individuals
            who sit atop our financial system, those of us who advocate debt
            resistance take our collective responsibility very seriously. By
            dissolving the bonds that bind us to corporations, financial
            institutions, and governments all over the world, we seek to forge
            new bonds with one another based on equitable and sustainable forms
            of exchange.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time of this writing, examples of financial manipulation
            continue to arise. Matt Taibbi recently wrote an article revealing
            another scandal equal to or greater than Libor. It is titled, “<a

              target="_blank"
              >Everything Is Rigged: The Biggest Price-Fixing Scandal Ever</a
            >.” The subtitle goes on to report, “The second huge financial
            scandal of the year reveals the real international conspiracy:
            There’s no price the big banks can’t fix.” But this is no aberration
            of capitalism; this is its essence.

            Remember: we don’t owe Wall Street anything, we owe each other
            everything. The possibilities of organizing around debt resistance
            are only beginning to be realized. Strike Debt, like Occupy Wall
            Street, hopes to inspire both autonomous action and collective
            resistance.
