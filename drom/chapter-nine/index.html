              >over a billion times each year</a

            in the United States, according to industry estimates. Debt
            collection has become a complex global industry, reliant on
            strong-arm tactics including harassing phone calls and threats that
            are often illegal. The coercion runs along a spectrum from moral
            persuasion to threats of violence, and increasingly involves
            institutions such as the courts and law enforcement. Given the
            complexity of debt collection laws and regulations that vary from
            state to state, there are hundreds of ways a debt collector can
            engage in illegal practices. It’s important to know your rights and
            to record abusive and illegal practices. In many cases, your debt
            can be erased (due to collectors’ misconduct) or reduced. In some
            cases, you might even have the right to sue for damages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Debt collectors count on you to not do your homework. They count on
            you to be an easy mark and to be overwhelmed by bureaucracy,
            harassment, and shame. Our current economic downturn only amplifies
            the problem. Most people have less money and more debt. Debt
            collectors themselves are making less money per account (it’s highly
            labor intensive with collectors making contact with only about

              target="_blank"
              >fifteen out of two hundred or more targets</a
            >), causing more aggressive and increasingly illegal tactics. Even
            if collectors do not engage in activities and techniques that are
            technically illegal, they are likely to use intentionally deceptive
            practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this chapter we briefly describe some of the laws around debt
            collection, the different ways debt is collected, who is hurt most
            by the debt collection industry, and what people can do to protect
            themselves, their families, and their communities. While this
            chapter can’t tell you everything you need to know to handle your
            specific situation, it provides a basic outline of how the debt
            collection industry works and points you to resources that can help
            you fight this system that wants you to fail.
          </p>
          <h2 class="submenu">
            What Is a Collection Agency and Why Are They Calling You?
          </h2>
          <p>
            A collection agency often works on behalf of an original creditor
            (OC). An OC can be a department store, a credit card company, or a
            hospital—basically wherever you open a line of credit. When bills go
            unpaid, the OC contracts with collection agencies or third-party
            debt collectors to collect the debt. Some collection agencies take a
            commission of every debt they collect on behalf of the OC, while
            other agencies lease or buy your debt outright from the OC after a
            period of non-payment. But the collection agency doesn’t pay full
            price. In fact, it will almost certainly pay much less, usually
            2–25% of the debt’s face value. So if you owe $1,000, the collection
            agency might pay $150 for the right to collect that $1,000 from you.
            They then attempt to collect the full $1,000, and more if fees are
            attached, making a hefty profit in the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, the collection agency is essentially buying the right to
            take a gamble on your debt—debt that the OC may have already charged
            off. But they aren’t just buying <i>your</i> debt. They are buying
            the debts of hundreds, even thousands, of people like you at a time.
            For their gamble to pay off, they need to convince only a small
            minority of consumers—through legal means or otherwise—to pay. The
            collection agency might also tack on additional late fees and
            interest all while harassing you by phone and by mail to collect.
          </p>
          <h3>The debt collection machine</h3>
          <p>
            The debt collection industry—also known as “accounts receivable
            management,” or ARM for short—is financed by Wall Street and closely
            tied to credit card issuers and other lenders such as collection
            companies, offshore call centers, big law firms, and debt
            speculators. Each year, over three hundred thousand debt collectors
            amass more than $50 billion in debt,
            <a

              target="_blank"
              >profiting over $10 billion total</a
            >. The collection industry has expanded significantly in recent
            years, shadowing the rise of consumer credit. From 2000 until the
            end of 2010, commercial banks

            >. Should consumers default, the debt collection industry is ready.
            The number of U.S. consumers subject to third-party debt collectors
            has doubled since 2000. Ten years ago, debt collectors pursued one
            in fourteen people in the United States; today, it’s

              >one in seven</a

            divorce, or unemployment—even death. “<a

            <em>New York Times</em> reported in 2009. Collection agencies like

            and pressure them to pay, even though they are not legally obligated
            to assume the debt of a spouse, sibling, or parent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Credit card debt and other small loans are bought and sold like
            other debt obligations, e.g., mortgages and student loans, as part
            of big portfolios. The biggest are managed by the largest debt
            buyers. The largest collection agency, NCO Group, is owned by the
            nation’s biggest bank, JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase and other big
            banks supply enormous lines of credit to the leading debt buyers in
            order to “generate cash flow.” Creditors profit at your expense on
            multiple levels, creating a dependent and exploitative relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, debt collectors increasingly rely on the civil court system
            and local law enforcement to secure legal judgments to garnish
            wages, freeze bank accounts, and seize property. According to a
            report by the National Consumer Law Center, “Often, the grab extends
            to people who have already repaid or never owed the debts—parents,
            children, people with similar names, victims of identity theft.
            Harassment, threats, and even jail become

            with collectors in what amounts to a government-sponsored shakedown,
            lending out their official letterhead to give the impression that
            failure to pay up could lead to criminal charges. The collectors

          <h3>How a collection agency thinks</h3>

            if you want to know how to best engage with them. First, it is
            usually pointless to go back and contact the original creditor. The
            OC almost certainly has an agreement with the collection agency that
            prevents them from negotiating directly with you. Collectors often
            receive little training beyond, “Here’s your desk, your phone, and
            your computer—now go make us some money.” Many collection agency
            workers’ pay is tied to a monthly quota of how many debts they
            collect, and it’s common for collectors to employ more aggressive
            and illegal tactics toward the end of the month. Because they work
            on monthly commission, individual collectors are also most likely to
            pursue the people with the largest debts and the people who seem
            most likely to pay. Collectors usually start with a relatively low
            base pay and, at larger agencies, their bonus is usually 2% of the
            overall debt they collected, giving them an incentive to

          <p>
            There are two common types of collection agencies: letter
            writers—who write letters directing you back to the OC to make your
            payment—and just plain “collection agencies”—who require you to pay
            them directly so they can get their commission from the OC or make
            back the money they’ve already paid to buy your debt. Both must
            include a mini-Miranda (a required statement from the collectors
            stating they’re collecting a debt and any information gathered will
            be used to collect that debt) in their letters or read aloud during
            their phone calls. If they do not, you may have grounds to sue.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your first contact with a collection agency is over the phone,
            the mini-Miranda warning should sound something like this:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Hello, I am [name of collector]. I am [or “this office is”] a debt
              collector representing [creditor]. Information obtained during the
              course of this call will be used for the purpose of collecting the
              debt.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            If your first contact with the collection agency is via mail, the
            mini-Miranda should look something like this:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              This correspondence is an attempt to collect a debt. Any
              information obtained will be used for that purpose. Unless within
              thirty days of your receipt of this notice, you notify us that you
              dispute the validity of this debt, it will be assumed to be
              correct. If you notify this office within thirty days that you
              dispute the validity of the debt, we will obtain verification of
              the debt or a copy of the judgment. If you request it within
              thirty days, we will provide you with the name and address of the
              original creditor (if different from the current creditor).

            <i>Do not ignore the call or letter</i>. The biggest mistake people
            make when they get letters or calls from debt collection agencies is
            to ignore them and hope they will go away. Because you have thirty
            days to contest the debt, you <i>must</i> act immediately. If you
            ignore the contact, you are by default agreeing that the debt is
            legitimate. If it is legal in your state, you can record your
            conversations and create a log of how often they contact you. If you
            are uncertain about your state’s laws, consulting a lawyer would be
            wise.

          <h3>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</h3>
          <p>
            Over the past year, the newly established Consumer Financial
            Protection Bureau (CFPB) has set their sights on the debt collection
            industry. They will

            collecting, collectors going after debt on behalf of an original
            creditor, and companies litigating to collect debt. The CFPB
            supervises 175 of the 4,500 companies officially classified as debt
            collectors. Although those companies take in about 63% of the
            industry’s account receipts, they represent a small percentage of
            the industry itself. The bureau’s rules only cover companies that
            have over $10 million in annual receipts,

            from these regulations. Because these larger companies tend to work
            with larger creditors (who have stricter requirements), they are
            often not the ones consumers have to worry about. The CFPB is also
            looking to regulate collectors who use

            to track down and harass debtors. There isn’t much information on
            the CFPB because it is so new, but debtors of all stripes should be
            aware of the organization and keep up to date with its development.
          </p>
          <h3>Statute of limitations on debt</h3>
          <p>
            In every state there is a statute of limitations (SOL) for
            outstanding debts—a limit on the number of years in which a creditor
            may attempt to pursue payment. (It should be noted, however, that
            federal student loans, child support obligations, and income taxes
            in certain states like California do <i>not</i> have a statute of
            limitations.) Each state is different, so
            <a
              title="“State-by-State List of Statute of Limitations on Debt”"
              href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMIrby"
              target="_blank"
              >you should check</a
            >. Kentucky and Ohio have extremely long periods (fifteen years for
            written debt agreements) while Mississippi and North Carolina have
            much shorter periods (three years for written debt agreements). In
            most states, however, debt collectors can still attempt to collect
            debt after the SOL expires. Even after it expires, courts may award
            judgments against you if you fail to raise the SOL as a defense.
            Ordinarily it is up to the person being sued to point out that the
            SOL has expired. If there is a dispute about which state’s laws
            apply, you can be sure that the collection agency will argue for the
            state with the longer period.
          </p>
          <h4>When does the SOL clock start?</h4>
          <p>
            The SOL clock starts running on the date of the last activity of
            your account. This is often the date of your last payment but—and
            this is key—it may also be the date when you entered into a payment
            agreement or simply acknowledged liability for the debt. This is why
            it is important to always contest liability. If your debt is beyond
            the SOL you can contest the debt on these grounds and, should you
            want to play offense, you can also attempt to set up the collection
            agency for an FDCPA violation and hit them with a lawsuit.
          </p>
          <h3>Know your FDCPA violations</h3>
          <p>
            Even if your debt falls within the SOL, there is a good chance the
            debt collector will engage in abusive or deceptive practices that
            are illegal under the FDCPA, but it is up to you to know your
            rights, be vigilant, and document any violations. Violations are
            grounds for dismissing debt and related lawsuits. Not all collectors
            are subject to the FDCPA’s rules, however. Third party collectors,
            debt buyers, and law firms must comply with the FDCPA, but in-house
            collectors, or creditors who are trying to collect their
            <i>own</i> debts, do not have to follow the FDCPA.
          </p>
          <h4>Some common FDCPA violations</h4>
          <p>
            There are countless ways collectors violate the FDCPA and the longer
            you engage with a debt collector or agency (while continuing to
            dispute the debt), the greater the chance you will catch them in the
            act. Unfortunately (or fortunately if you’re a debt collector) only
            a small fraction of violations go reported. You do not need a lawyer
            to contest debt obligations or report FDCPA violations; you can take
            action on your own and even win damages. If you decide to sue a
            collector, you must do so within one year from the date the law was
            violated. If you win, you could

            Due to lax regulations and a lack of will to enforce them, debt
            collectors routinely break the law by verbally abusing and
            threatening debtors. Some debt collectors have

              >“embedded” themselves in hospitals</a
            >, pretending to be hospital employees and approaching people when
            they’re at their most vulnerable. Jessica Silver-Greenberg writes,
            “To patients, the debt collectors may look indistinguishable from
            hospital employees, may demand they pay outstanding bills and may
            discourage them from seeking emergency care at all, even using
            scripts like those in collection boiler rooms.”<a

            ></a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Debt collectors also call pretending to be police officers and claim
            that they have a warrant to arrest a debtor if they don’t pay up.
            Collectors will often continually harass people for debts that they
            don’t owe, have already paid, or have already been dismissed in
            court. Collectors frequently target the wrong person, mistaking one
            person for someone else with the same or similar name. Debt
            collectors will lie and say that they are calling on behalf of debt
            relief agencies, learn all about a debtor’s situation, and collect
            all of their personal information and then use it against them.
            Collectors have been known to illegally call employers and inform
            them of employees’ debts. In the most extreme cases, debt collectors
            have made disturbing threats to

            Even debt collectors who follow the law can legally mislead you or
            trick you in other ways. Credit card companies have started
            data-mining cardholder’s purchases and using software to create
            psychological profiles of them. These profiles are then used by debt
            collectors to psychologically manipulate debtors to pay more than
            they have to, including artificial late fees that would otherwise
            have been waived. This tactic, although manipulative and immoral, is
            completely legal. After using a

          <p>
            Debt buyers also contract with specialized collection law firms to
            collect on debts. In recent years, these firms have swamped small
            claims and other state courts, filing “mass-produced” lawsuits,
            mirroring reckless practices in the mortgage market, such as
            “robo-signing.” Despite the fact that these suits typically lack
            proper documentation, most result in judgments, as the proceedings
            are skewed against debtors. If consumers are lucky enough to be
            properly “served,” or notified of the lawsuits filed against them,
            many of them will not even have access to civil courts due to the
            forced arbitration clauses in millions of credit card and other
            consumer loan contracts. These lawsuits pay little regard to
            accuracy. Noach Dear, a civil court judge in Brooklyn who has
            presided over as many as one hundred credit card lawsuit cases in
            one day, estimates that “roughly 90 percent of the credit card
            lawsuits are flawed and

            Not all hope is lost, though. If you suspect you’ve fallen victim to
            “robo-signing,” you can do a few things to fight back. First, you or
            an attorney should read the complaint and supporting documents
            carefully for any omissions, errors, or deceptions that could help
            you win. If your state requires debt buyers to be licensed, check
            whether the debt buyer is licensed. Suing without a license may
            constitute a violation of the FDCPA. You should also check to see if

            documents and if they have proof of the underlying contract. Often a
            contract is not even attached to the complaint and, if it is, it’s
            often photocopied and illegible. Carefully scrutinize the affidavit

            up the affiant’s signature online and the signature in front of you
            does not match, you may have grounds for contestation. The burden of
            proof is with the affiant and the collectors, so make sure they can
            prove they know your case front to back. If they don’t, you may be

          <p>
            With all of this in mind, it’s important to know what debt
            collectors legally can and can’t do. Below is a basic list to help
            protect you:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A debt collector can only call a third party once about you unless
              it believes the third party gave it false information the first
              time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contacting you before 8:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m. is illegal.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must tell a collector not to contact you at work or by phone
              by sending them a cease and desist letter (<i
                >see
                <a
                  title="Appendix D: Sample Letters to Collection Agencies"

                  >Appendix D</a
                >, sample letter #2</i
              >). You must send this certified mail and keep a copy for yourself
              so you have proof of receipt. If the collection agency contacts
              you again, other than to advise you of their intent to take
              action, then they are violating the FDCPA.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is your right not to speak with debt collectors; however, that
              doesn’t cancel the debt.
            </li>
            <li>
              A debt collector cannot sell a debt to another collection agency
              knowing that it has expired (<i>see SOL</i>) or is in dispute.
            </li>
            <li>
              A debt collector may try to lead you to believe that you have no
              grounds for requesting a “validation of debt” (<i
                >see
                <a

              >).
            </li>
            <li>
              A debt collector may try to represent themselves as an attorney or
              law firm even if they are actually not an attorney or law firm.
              Regardless, collection attorneys have to follow the FDCPA just
              like collection agencies.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a debt collector sends an initial notice advising you of your
              right to a validation of debt, then they cannot demand payment
              within the next thirty days.
            </li>
            <li>
              A collector cannot call your job and tell your HR department that
              they need your work information (wages, schedule) unless a valid
              suit was filed by them and tried in a court of law with a judgment
              in their favor. Until this happens (if it happens), they cannot
              contact your HR department or place of work, even if they claim to
              be looking for information to sue you. It is legal, however, for
              credit rating agencies to buy your personal data (employment and
              salary records) and

            </li>
            <li>
              It is not unheard of for debt collectors to use fake case numbers
              and fake lawyers to scare an alleged debtor into paying. This is
              in clear violation of the FDCPA.
            </li>
            <li>
              The mini-Miranda (<i>see above</i>) should be on each and every
              communication you get from a debt collector.
            </li>
            <li>
              A collector is not allowed to reveal information about the
              envelope’s contents on the outside of the envelope for others to
              see. Words such as “past due” or “collections” are in clear
              violation of the FDCPA.
            </li>
            <li>
              A debt collector cannot impersonate a law officer or claim they
              can throw you in jail for not paying your alleged debt.
            </li>

          <p>
            Hopefully you don’t ever see a lawsuit, but if you do, you should
            know what you can expect and its implications on you and society at
            large. Plaintiffs file lawsuits because they assume: (1) the vast
            majority of consumers will not show up or contest lawsuits, and (2)
            a majority of judges will award a default judgment in the vast
            majority of cases, based often on

            yourself. Unfortunately, due to intimidation and illegal tactics,
            collectors and creditors often force debtors into the criminal
            justice system. These practices most directly affect working-class
            people and people of color, and they contribute to and sustain what
            is today known as the prison-industrial complex.

          <h3>On debt row</h3>
          <p>
            In 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court made it illegal for indigent people
            to be imprisoned for failing to pay their debts. Yet to this day,
            people are locked up for being in debt. In 2009, for example,
            Minnesota courts issued

            serving time, they are burdened with legal financial obligations
            (LFOs). LFOs are

              >fines, fees, and other costs</a
            >
            associated with a criminal sentence, such as supervision fees if on
            probation, administrative fees, “pay to stay” fees, and prison
            fees. LFOs pile up quickly, causing debtors to waive legal counsel
            because of those costs, which increases the likelihood of
            re-incarceration. This leads to a cycle of debt and imprisonment
            that many people are unable to escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fees often begin even before one reaches the courthouse. The people
            sued—often low-income, elderly, or disabled people—frequently do not
            receive notice and are not aware of court proceedings. If they are
            notified, many people cannot defend themselves even though some of
            these lawsuits are filed without having proof of any debt owed. At
            least thirteen states, for example, authorize or mandate charging
            indigent individuals

          <h2 class="submenu">Wage Garnishment and Work</h2>
          <p>
            Debts can also be collected through wage garnishment, which
            basically means that your employer withholds some of your wages if
            ordered to do so by a court or the government. The amount that can
            be seized depends on your “disposable income,” or the amount left
            after legally required deductions are made (such as taxes and
            employee retirement systems). It is important that you check how
            much of your wages can be garnished based on your income so you
            don’t end up in any more financial trouble. Although Title III of
            the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA) forbids any employer from
            firing you because of any one debt, you <i>can</i> be fired if your
            wages need to be garnished for two or more debts. If your employer
            commits any
            <a
              title="“Wages and Hours Worked: Wage Garnishment”"

              target="_blank"
              >Title III violations</a
            >, you may have grounds for reinstatement to your job, payment of
            back wages, and a restoration of the garnished amount. Wage
            garnishment laws can differ from state to state, so it’s best to
            look up what your state does and does not allow. If a state’s
            garnishment law differs from Title III of the federal wage
            garnishment law, your employer must observe the law that requires
            the <i>smaller</i> garnishment amount. For specific information on
            how much your wages can be garnished, it’s best to contact the
            Federal Trade Commission, the CFPB, or your state’s attorney
            general.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’ve had a judgment made against you, employers can choose not
            to hire you if they don’t want to go through the trouble of having
            to dedicate their resources to fulfilling a court’s order. Your bank
            may also freeze your account after they receive a garnishment order.
            If you’ve written checks or have your account tied to electronic
            payments, those payments may go unpaid. Depending on the bank, they
            may charge you with having insufficient funds. If your bank account
            has been frozen, you should seek an attorney right away. You should
            also tell the bank if your account has funds that are exempt from
            being frozen or garnished.

          <p>
            Debt collection is not merely a particular job of the collection
            industry. It is not just an aftershock of a credit transaction gone
            wrong. Rather, it is a powerful weapon—one that is used
            intentionally—that controls your time, your work, and your
            relationship with the people around you. Debt collection is a
            practice that extends to every level of society, from the courts and
            credit rating agencies to your workplace, your home, and your
            community. Debt collection isn’t exclusively the domain of debt
            collection agencies, either. The federal government, municipalities,
            employers, and private companies all have the power to collect debt
            and view you as a means to make more money. Though the individual
            consequences are severe, debt collection—as a way of punishing and
            extracting profit from working people—preserves wider racial and
            economic inequalities, harming millions and undermining the struggle
            for a more egalitarian society.
          </p>
          <h2 class="submenu">Ideas for Collective Action</h2>
          <p>
            It remains to be seen how effective and “consumer friendly” the
            Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be, but people should not
            always expect to rely on them or the Federal Trade Commission to
            solve their problems. There is no cure-all for resisting debt
            collection. Debt affects people differently and everyone has
            different experiences. A good first step is to try to educate
            yourself and your friends on how debt collection works, who the big
            players are, and what powers you potentially have to resist. Open up
            that conversation and talk to each other to find solutions together.
            Ask why you owe anything at all and how you got into the situation
            you’re in. Are you “just irresponsible” (as debtors have often been
            told) or are there larger factors at play that have to do with
            employment, racism, and other forms of exploitation and oppression?
            Is it a matter of us spending beyond our means or is it about who
            controls our labor and wages, our value, and our worth?
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to sharing information, experiences, and strategies with
            others, there are two other main ways we can begin to fight back
            against debt collectors: letter-writing, and lawsuits for violating
            the FDCPA. Both could be made into mass actions that attempt to
            overwhelm debt collectors while also helping us reduce our debts.
            With the right organizational structure, debtors being chased by a
            common debt collector or debt collection agency can coordinate a
            well-timed letter-writing campaign to dispute their debts. If many
            debts with the same collector are disputed, it will disrupt and
            possibly halt their business. As far as we know, such a collective
            action has never been tried. But if a collector violates the FDCPA
            (which won’t be hard to find out), a class-action lawsuit could be
            organized.
