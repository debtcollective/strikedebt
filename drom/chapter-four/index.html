        <h1>Student Debt: Foreclosing on the Future</h1>
        <!--<article  id="post-">-->

        <article class="content">
          <p>
            In the not-too-distant past, high school graduates in the United
            States seeking a meaningful college education could likely have
            received one from an in-state or city university at little to no
            cost. And it would have been reasonable for them to assume that the
            degree they earned would significantly increase life opportunities.
            Though that era was relatively short-lived here, many other
            countries have made access to free or low-cost higher education an
            enduring priority, insisting on it being a basic right and a good
            that benefits society as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            These days though, back here in the United States, higher education
            has sadly become one of the biggest debt traps of all—turning many
            of us into lifelong debtors. Even in the midst of the Great
            Recession, college costs have continued to skyrocket. Funding for
            our once robust and affordable state university system—a symbol of a
            collective commitment to broadening opportunity and shared
            prosperity—has been whittled away over time, with the burden of
            education costs shifted onto students and their families in the form
            of severe tuition and fee hikes. The story at private schools is
            equally grim, with already out-of-reach average tuition nearly
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMBaum2" target="_blank"
              >tripling in cost since 1980</a
            >. And though it’s become common knowledge that a college degree is
            a prerequisite for obtaining a decent job, we are increasingly being
            told that we need an expensive master’s degree too, with few grants
            available to those scrambling to enroll.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the absence of free or low-cost options, students are taking on
            life-altering debts to cover astronomically high tuition, fees, and
            living costs, coerced through fears of an uncertain financial future
            and false promises of stable careers. Lenders, loan servicers, Wall
            Street investors, school administrators, predatory for-profit
            colleges, and even the government are raking in profits at students’
            expense. As a result, in 2012, the total amount of student debt owed
            in the United States surpassed the $1 trillion mark—higher than
            credit card debt or any other kind of consumer debt with the
            exception of mortgage debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two-thirds of U.S. students are leaving college with an average of
            $27,000 in debt, with the burden falling disproportionately on
            Native Americans, Blacks, and Latino/as. And with too few jobs on
            the horizon, it’s no surprise that defaults are now occurring at the
            astonishing rate of one million per year. Almost one in six
            borrowers is in default, with many others on the brink. Of the class
            of 2005,
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMCunningham" target="_blank"
              >41% are already delinquent or in default</a
            >. Experienced on a personal level, this combination of chronic
            underemployment and massive indebtedness has given many the sense
            that their futures have been foreclosed upon, leading them into
            depression and some even to suicide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the enormous sticker price for college, students often don’t
            even qualify for enough crushing loans to pay the full cost. As
            such, parents are increasingly taking out or cosigning loans on
            their children’s behalf and facing the same repayment problems as
            their offspring. It’s no wonder then that seniors are now the
            fastest growing population of student debtors. At the same time,
            unemployment for people under twenty-five is almost twice the
            national average, meaning that young people are being forced to
            depend on their parents for longer periods of time after graduating.
            As a result, many parents are putting off retirement in order to
            continue to provide for their families while struggling to cover the
            added expense of student loan repayment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that, in 2012, seniors
            owed around $36 billion in student loans, or about 4.2% of total
            U.S. student loan debt. For the sizable number of those who are in
            default, their Social Security benefits are subject to seizure. This
            growing predicament piles layers of guilt on top of the fear and
            depression experienced by younger debtors when they realize that not
            only are they unable to assist their parents through their
            retirement years, they are also a direct cause of their parents’
            added economic burden.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given this grim picture, some analysts argue that there is a student
            debt “bubble” about to burst. Unlike the housing bubble, a mass
            devaluation of outstanding student loans might not be a bad thing
            for debtors. After all, the creditors can’t repossess your degree or
            your brain—or at least not yet! But there are harsh penalties for
            defaulting, making any bet that your debt-burden will someday be
            reduced a risky one at best.
          </p>
          <p>
            This chapter explains how student debt was created, who profits from
            it and how you can survive as a debtor. Above all, you should know
            that you are not alone if you are facing default. There are ways of
            resisting, especially by acting together.
          </p>
          <h2 class="submenu">How It Got So Bad</h2>
          <p>
            Going to public college used to be pretty affordable, especially for
            those on the GI Bill, or those who went to public colleges like the
            City University of New York or the University of California. Alarmed
            at the rise of student activism and guided by simplistic free-market
            ideals of “personal responsibility,” conservatives took advantage of
            the fiscal crises in the mid-1970s to clamp down on free tuition and
            open admissions policies. A temporary season of austerity measures
            turned into an enduring epoch as cuts by state lawmakers continued
            throughout the 1980s and down to this day. Neoliberal policy-making,
            aimed at privatizing public responsibilities, has increasingly
            transferred the financial burden from the state onto individual
            students. As
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMUC" target="_blank"
              >an example of the results</a
            >, in 1976, a student at the University of California paid only $647
            in annual fees; by 2012, the bill had reached $13,181.When these are
            the most “affordable” options, students from low-income homes
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMSchoof" target="_blank"
              >regularly end up owing a third, half or even more</a
            >
            of their family’s annual earnings for a year of tuition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the costs of a college education have risen by more than
            1,100% in the last three decades. With grants and scholarships
            lagging far behind tuition increases, student loans are the only
            option for most who want a college education. And in a knowledge
            economy, where a college degree is considered a passport to a decent
            livelihood, there’s really not much of a choice but to take on
            loans, committing large chunks of your future earnings to pay back
            the debts you got stuck with simply trying to prepare yourself for
            employability in the first place. This kind of contract is the
            essence of indenture.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make matters considerably worse, in 1998 Congress took the
            extraordinary step of making federally backed loans all but
            impossible to discharge through bankruptcy. After prolonged pressure
            from Wall Street creditors, private loans became ineligible in 2005,
            making student debt virtually the only kind of loan that doesn’t
            allow debtors the option of bankruptcy. As if that’s not enough, the
            government also granted enormous collection powers to lenders.
            Lending agencies can now garnish wages and seize tax returns without
            even requesting a legal hearing first. Even Social Security and
            disability wages are
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMKingkade" target="_blank"
              >subject to garnishment</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            The knowledge that students have little choice but to debt-finance
            their education however high the cost has created some perverse
            incentives for college and university administrators, warping
            educational priorities and putting further upward pressure on
            tuition. In order to make up for financial shortfalls, colleges have
            increasingly turned to issuing bonds, using tuition as collateral to
            secure loans from Wall Street. For example, in 2012, the University
            of California sold almost $1 billion in bonds set to mature over the
            next hundred years. That means UC students’ tuition dollars will be
            used to line the pockets of big investors over the next ten decades.
            To ensure a steady flow of riches, financiers hold colleges hostage

            Given the cultural shift from a model based more on public funding
            to one where education is seen largely as a commodity for individual
            purchase, many administrators have quite logically responded by
            marketing their schools as luxury goods. They fill their
            ever-expanding campuses with extravagant dorms and
            “state-of-the-art” facilities designed by big-name architects, and
            invest in non-academic “lifestyle” services and perks. They
            certainly don’t skimp when it comes to their own salaries. Average
            pay for administrators increased dramatically in recent years, with
            many private and public school presidents, provosts, and chancellors
            falling well within the top 1% of income “earners.” And when
            endowments fail to cover the tab, faculty who do the apparently less
            important work of actual teaching can always be replaced by adjunct
            professors who get paid far less and receive little in the way of
            benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            A luxury education might be fun for some, but upon graduation,
            debtors must quickly learn to walk a treacherously thin tightrope.
            Student debt can endure for decades, employment prospects are more
            and more precarious, and wages have been stagnating. But a credit
            report damaged by even one or two delayed payments can generate
            additional obstacles to finding work, as employers are now
            increasingly demanding that potential hires agree to undergo
            intrusive and unreliable credit checks as part of the application
            process. Thus debtors tend to put their preferred career paths on
            hold (and therefore risk abandoning them) until they have finally
            paid off their loans through employment options that are much less
            desirable. Ironically, one of the quickest paths to paying off debts
            for some students is to find work in the finance industry, issuing
            loans or speculating on derivatives.

            Wall Street lenders have made a killing on the debt-financing of
            education, especially in the decades before federal loans were
            reorganized in 2010. Sallie Mae, sometimes referred to as the
            “queen” of student lending, was created in 1972 as a
            government-sponsored enterprise. But in 1977, as the business of
            student loans became more and more lucrative, the push to privatize
            began. By 2004, Sallie Mae was fully publicly traded. The company
            now has a hand in both federal and private student loans and draws
            its profits from
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMTreasury" target="_blank"
              >every aspect of the student loan industry</a
            >: originating, servicing, and collecting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 1972 and 2010, under the FFELP (Federal Family Education
            Loan Program) lending system, federal loans originated by financial
            institutions (including Wall Street banks) were fully guaranteed and
            subsidized by the government. In 2010, the Obama administration cut
            out the middlemen, which means that any federal loan taken out now
            is originated directly by the federal government. However, these
            government loans are still serviced by a group of select private
            institutions, including Sallie Mae. That means that the government
            pays these servicers millions of dollars a year in order to handle
            the billing and other maintenance of the loan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even more recently, under the thin guise of easing the burden of
            debtors, Congress and the president did away with the unjustifiably
            high 6.8% interest rate on federal loans, replacing it with a
            <i>temporarily</i> lower adjustable rate tied to returns on ten-year
            treasury notes—creating a time bomb that will explode in students’
            faces once treasury rates go up again, as they surely will. But
            don’t worry! The rate for loans is capped at 8.25%. Now don’t you
            feel better?
          </p>
          <p>
            As if all that weren’t bad enough, Federal loans rarely meet the
            full cost of education, leaving many students with no choice but to
            take out private loans to make up the difference. Even though only
            20% of all current student loans are private, at the current rate of
            issuance their overall volume will have surpassed that of federal
            loans in ten to fifteen years. These private student loans are
            subject to different terms and have much higher interest rates.

            Many college financial aid officials are in cahoots with private
            lenders. A 2006 investigation by the New York State Attorney
            General’s Office concluded that the business relationship between
            lenders and university officials amounted to an “unholy alliance.”
            Lenders paid kickbacks to universities based on the loan volume that
            financial aid offices steered their way; they also gave
            all-expenses-paid Caribbean vacations to financial aid
            administrators and even put them on their payroll. In addition,
            lenders set up funds and credit lines for schools in exchange for
            being placed on
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMLederman" target="_blank"
              >preferred-lender lists</a
            >. In spite of these scandals, and despite the NYS Attorney
            General’s recommendation that bankruptcy protections be restored to
            student lenders, nothing really changed. The student loan racket was
            just too profitable to be reined in by a few grandstanding
            regulators.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lack of protection for consumers has made default quite
            profitable for lenders. On average, 120% of the principal on a
            defaulted loan is ultimately collected. In fact, in 2003 Sallie Mae
            disclosed that its record-breaking profits were due in significant
            part to collections on defaulted loans. Two years earlier, the
            company was caught declaring loans to be in default before even
            trying to collect the debt. This rapacious conduct is the norm in
            some quarters of the student lending industry (Collinge 2009).

            As in the subprime mortgage market, many private loans are
            securitized—packaged and sold to the highest bidder as Student Loan
            Asset-Backed Securities (SLABS). These SLABS account for almost a
            quarter—$234.2 billion—of the aggregate $1 trillion debt. Since
            SLABS are often bundled with other kinds of loans and traded on
            secondary debt markets, investors are not only speculating on the
            risk status of student loans but also profiting from

          <h3>The uneven social impact</h3>
          <p>
            The human toll of all this is becoming increasingly visible. For a
            host of disturbing accounts of student debt, it’s well worth reading
            Alan Collinge’s book
            <i
              >Student Loan Scam: The Most Oppressive Debt in U.S. History—and
              How We Can Fight Back</i
            >. And it’s certainly not hard to find student debt horror stories
            all over the internet, especially in the wake of Occupy Wall Street,
            which inspired many debtors to “come out” online. A military veteran
            reports that he has paid $18,000 on a $2,500 loan and Sallie Mae
            claims the man still owes $5,000; the bankrupt husband of a social
            worker, bedridden after a botched surgery, tells of a $13,000
            college loan balance from the 1980s that ballooned to $70,000; a
            grandmother subsisting on Social Security has her payments garnished
            to pay off a $20,000 loan balance from a ten-year-old $3,500 student
            loan she took out before undergoing brain surgery. Loans like these
            grow rapidly due to a combination of compounding interest and
            forbearance programs. In fact, only 37% of student loans are in
            repayment at any given time. The other 63% are accruing interest,
            adding fees and becoming more and more likely to add to the six
            million student loans

            While the single largest debt loads are racked up by students from
            middle-income families seeking a private university degree, the
            overall impact of debt is
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMBaum" target="_blank">magnified</a>
            among low-income families. Of those who have earned bachelor’s
            degrees, about 81% of Black students and 67% of Latino/a students
            leave school with debt, compared to 64% of White students. As a
            result of the home equity losses suffered since 2008, Black people
            lost a huge portion of the economic gains they had made in the
            post–civil rights era. Reflecting those losses, Black students have
            had to borrow more for education than Whites, and the racial
            inequity of the employment landscape means they are twice as likely
            to be unemployed on graduation. Also, students of color are much
            more likely to enroll in for-profit schools, which have high
            non-completion rates and account for nearly half of student loan
            defaults. These proprietary colleges (we should call them “Wall
            Street’s colleges”) engage in reverse redlining, explicitly
            targeting students of color for recruitment, loading them with debt
            in return for a dubious educational experience. It’s no surprise
            then that the default rate for Black people is
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMHing" target="_blank">four times</a>
            that of Whites.

            One of the worst examples of debt-financing in the for-profit sector
            stems from the introduction of the new GI Bill, introduced by
            Congress in 2008 to help veterans of the wars in Iraq and
            Afghanistan enter the higher education system. Almost a third of the
            GI Bill monies have ended up in the coffers of
            <a

              target="_blank"
              >for-profit colleges</a
            >. These colleges have exploited a legislative loophole that allows
            them to count GI Bill money as part of the 10% of revenue they are
            required to raise from non-public sources in order to be eligible to
            receive federal student loans, which account for the other 90% of
            their revenue. The result has been an aggressive recruitment of
            ex-soldiers—some were so brain-damaged from their injuries they
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMLewin" target="_blank"
              >had no idea</a
            >
            what they were signing—with an inevitable impact upon veterans of
            color, who serve disproportionately in the armed services. Excluded
            from most of the homeownership and education benefits of the
            original GI Bill, Native Americans, Blacks, and Latino/as are being
            preyed upon and debt-burdened by the latest bill.

          <h2 class="submenu">Avoiding Default</h2>
          <p>
            Your loan becomes <i>delinquent</i> the first day after you miss a
            payment. The delinquency will continue until all back payments are
            made. Loan servicers report delinquencies of at least 90 days (and
            in some cases as early as 30 days) to the three major credit
            bureaus. As we’ve seen in
            <a
              title="Chapter One. Credit Scores and Consumer Reporting Agencies: Surveillance and the Vicious Cycle of Debt"
              href="/drom/chapter-one/"
              target="_blank"
              >Chapter One</a
            >, a negative credit report may make it difficult for you to meet
            your basic needs.<b> </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Student loans are generally considered to be in <i>default </i>when
            you fail to make a payment for 270 days for a federal loan or 120
            days for a private loan, though the industry standard for private
            loans is 180 days. Though the consequences of delinquency can be
            hard to bear, the penalties for default are of a much greater
            magnitude. If you can’t avoid delinquency but want to avoid default,
            try to make at least one payment every 120 (private) or 270
            (federal) days.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you haven’t defaulted but are alarmed about not being able to pay
            your student loans, do not panic. If you just graduated, many loans
            provide an automatic six-month deferment period. And if you have
            federal loans, you can extend this period on an annual basis either
            through deferment or forbearance programs. Deferment on certain
            loans halts interest during periods of unemployment, economic
            hardship or temporary disability, or while the debtor is in school.
            Forbearance—granted by a loan servicer to borrowers who don’t
            qualify for deferment—does not stop interest from accruing, but it
            does allow for some breathing room. But keep in mind that
            forbearance will cause the amount that you owe to increase.
            Typically, the interest is compounding annually, which means that at
            the end of a year it will be added to the principal and you will
            have to pay interest on that too. This can cause loans to mushroom,
            so check to see if you qualify for deferment before entering into
            forbearance.

            It may also be helpful to consolidate all of your loans into one. To

            There are a couple of newer programs that may also be helpful to
            those with federal loans: the Income-Based Repayment Plan (IBR) and
            Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Income-based repayment
            allows you to adjust payment to meet your income by capping payment
            at 15% of income based on family size. A single individual with no
            children making under $20,000 would pay 2.4% of income toward
            student debt whereas a family of four making under $100,000 would
            pay 9.9% of their income toward student debt. After twenty-five
            years, any remaining student loan debt would be forgiven. But there
            is a major caveat with this type of loan forgiveness. The government
            taxes loans that are written off, including IBR student loans, as
            <i>earned income</i>. This means that, after twenty-five years, the
            remainder of that loan is written off, but you will now owe what may
            be a significant amount in taxes, whether or not you can pay it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) provides forgiveness of
            federal student loan debt after ten years of continuous employment
            by any nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization, a federal,
            state, local, or tribal government agency including the military,
            public schools, and colleges, or while serving in AmeriCorps or the
            Peace Corps. You may
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMIBR" target="_blank"
              >also be eligible</a
            >
            if your employer is not a religious, union, or partisan political
            organization and provides public services. Loans forgiven through
            PSLF, unlike IBR, do not get taxed as earned income.
          </p>
          <h3>Being in default</h3>
          <p>
            If you are about to default on a student loan, remember that you are
            not alone. There are approximately six million other Americans that
            have already done so. While default can be a political act
            (especially when done collectively), any such decision should be
            made with full knowledge of the following possible consequences:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your loans may be turned over to a collection agency.</li>
            <li>
              You will be liable for the costs associated with collecting your
              loan, including court costs and attorney fees.
            </li>
            <li>You can be sued for the entire amount of your loan.</li>
            <li>
              Your wages may be garnished. Federal law limits the amount that
              may be garnished to 15% of the borrower’s take-home or
              “disposable” pay—the amount of income left after deducting any
              amounts required by law to be deducted. The wage garnishment
              amount is also subject to a ceiling that requires the borrower to
              be left with weekly earnings after the garnishment of at least
              thirty times the federal minimum wage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your federal and state income tax refunds may be intercepted.
            </li>
            <li>
              The federal government may withhold part of your Social Security
              benefit payments. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the government’s
              ability to collect defaulted student loans in this manner without
              a statute of limitations in
              <i>Lockhart v. United States</i> (December 2005).
            </li>
            <li>
              Your defaulted loans will appear on your credit history for up to
              seven years after the default claim is paid, making it difficult
              for you to obtain an auto loan, mortgage, or even credit cards. A
              bad credit record can also harm your ability to find a job. The
              U.S. Department of Education reports defaulted loans to
              TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian (<i

              If you had a cosigner on your loan (this is usually a parent or
              grandparent), they will be held legally responsible to pay back
              your loans. The penalties that apply to the person who took out
              the loan are also applied to cosigners who default.

            These measures are harsh, but you can continue to fight as an
            individual. Unfortunately, bankruptcy is not an option for student
            debtors, except occasionally in cases of permanent disability or
            “undue hardship.” Although it is difficult to get credit reporting
            agencies (CRAs) to remove defaulted student debt from reports, it is
            not impossible. You can use the strategies and resources outlined in
            <a
              title="Chapter Nine. Debt Collection: Don’t Feed the Vultures"
              href="/drom/chapter-nine/"

              >Chapter Nine</a
            >
            to demand that CRAs and debt collectors prove that the amount of
            your debt is fully verifiable. This will require a concerted
            letter-writing campaign, but you may be pleasantly surprised by the
            results. Often, recordkeeping is poor and the collector will not
            have access to any records that actually tie you to a debt,
            especially if your student loan was securitized into a SLAB.
            Although a court judgment is not required before your paycheck, bank
            account, or tax return is garnished, you are entitled to an
            administrative hearing if you request one.

            If you want to get out of default, you can often rehabilitate your
            loan by entering into an agreement to make twelve consecutive
            on-time payments to the original lender or the guarantee agency in
            exchange for the removal of the prior delinquency history from your
            credit report. Be sure to get this agreement in writing and to be
            clear about how this will be entered on your credit report, since
            amnesty agreements like this are technically noncompliant with the
            Fair Credit Reporting Act.

          <h3>Know your loans</h3>
          <p>
            As the number of middle-people standing between you and your
            original loan continues to increase, it can be hard to ascertain
            exactly who guarantees, originates, services, and collects your
            loans. To find out this information about your federal loans, visit
            the national student loan database at
            <a

            >.<b> </b>Things are a little more complicated when dealing with
            private loans. FinAid is a great first resource for understanding
            the variety of institutions involved:
            <a
              title="finaid.org/loans/studentloans.phtml"
              href="http://finaid.org/loans/studentloans.phtml"

              ><i>finaid.org/loans/studentloans.phtml</i></a
            >. It’s important to fully understand your own situation, since the
            laws apply unevenly to different kinds of financial institutions.
            For example, state guarantee agencies are exempt from the Fair Debt
            Collection Practices Act, but any private collection agency hunting
            you down must comply with this law. Be aware of their illegal
            practices and know your rights. This FinAid page about defaulting on
            student loans is a good place to start:

          <h2 class="submenu">Collective Action Toward Change</h2>
          <p>
            If we fight this system alone, the best we can hope for is to keep
            our heads above water. Collective action is the only true solution.
            There’s plenty of inspiration to be found outside of the United
            States, where powerful movements fighting to reclaim education as a
            basic right seem to be popping up everywhere. A wave of governments
            under the sway of neoliberal ideologues have been doing their best
            to undermine once well-funded university systems in hopes of
            imposing U.S.-style debt-financing on their students. But the
            immense suffering that system has created is no secret, and students
            across the globe have begun to draw lines in the sand, staging
            massive protests, strikes, and direct actions to resist.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2010, when the British government announced plans to cut funding
            and drastically raise tuition fees, students across the United
            Kingdom erupted in a series of massive protests. In London alone,
            fifty thousand students took to the streets on one day, many of them
            surrounding and occupying the Conservative Party headquarters.
            Starting in 2011 in Chile, where access to higher education has long
            been pitifully unequal, hundreds of thousands of students have
            filled the streets over and over again, paralyzing the education
            system and weakening government resolve to implement debt-financing
            and privatization. And in 2012, over three hundred thousand students
            went on strike in Québec, mobilizing mass popular support and
            virtually shutting down the university system in their struggle to
            resist tuition hikes. And the struggles continue.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here in the United States, we’re at a crossroads. After two
            generations of students and families suffering under punishing
            burdens of student debt, it seems to have finally become clear to
            most everyone that we are in a crisis. An insurgency of student
            debtors is on the rise. But the question remains as to where that
            momentum will lead us. Politicians—heavily beholden to the finance
            industry—campaign on promises of reform, offering market-based
            “solutions” that would further commit students to a debt-driven
            system where education is first and foremost a profit engine for
            financiers, asset speculators, and real estate developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            And some well-meaning groups organizing around student debt seem to
            be similarly stuck on solutions that continue to treat education as
            a commodity primarily benefitting individuals who purchase it. A
            recent grassroots effort put Oregon on the path to a system where
            the state pays tuition costs at public colleges upfront and students
            pay it back as a percentage of income for years into the future.
            However much such a program may increase access to education in the
            short term, requiring individual students to fund universities out
            of their paychecks normalizes the idea that education is a personal
            responsibility and in the long run could accelerate the replacement
            of publicly funded schools with lifetimes of indebtedness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other moderate, pro-capitalist reform proposals—including efforts to
            restore bankruptcy protection or to receive partial debt
            “forgiveness”—have produced little in the way of legislative change.
            While we are of course deeply in favor of building a movement around
            the debt crisis, any such movement must target the root of the
            problem, rather than pruning the foliage. In a truly democratic
            society, nobody would have to go into debt to earn a diploma. The
            pathway to this outcome does not lie in futile pleas for economic
            reform, but through a political movement driven by self-empowerment
            and direct action on the part of debtors.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re a current student, learning about your school’s governance
            and demanding fiscal transparency and accountability from your
            administrators and board is a powerful way to fight back. In April
            of 2013 in New York City, the president and board of directors of
            one of the very few tuition-free colleges left in the United
            States—the Cooper Union—announced that they would forsake the
            school’s 150-year-old mandate to provide free education and begin
            charging students up to $20,000 a year. Students who had been
            organizing in coordination with school faculty and staff in
            anticipation of such a move quickly occupied the office of the
            president, demanding not just a return to free tuition, but that
            decisions regarding the management of Cooper be opened up to the
            entire school community going forward. After sixty-five days, the
            board agreed to convene a working group composed of students,
            faculty, alumni, and administrators with the intention of restoring
            founder Peter Cooper’s vision of education that’s “as free as air
            and water.” Students also won a seat on the board and a permanent
            space to continue organizing.

            At the time of writing, the fall semester is about to begin and
            students from colleges and universities across New York City have
            organized disorientation campaigns, staging events and direct
            actions and distributing thoroughly researched guides to arm
            incoming students with the tools they’ll need to continue the
            struggle against the neoliberalization of our schools. Campaigns
            like these are spreading to schools across the country. Find out
            what’s going on in your area. Or start your own disorientation
            campaign!

          <p>
            The demand for a student debt jubilee was heard often during Occupy
            Wall Street, and the Occupy Student Debt Campaign (OSDC) that grew
            out of it did much important work toward articulating a vision of
            the what true change would look like. Others across the
            country—including Strike Debt, a direct descendent of OSDC—have
            begun to converge around a set of interlocking principles that
            should be central to any movement seeking to restore education as a
            social good and a right. To begin with, the federal government must
            make all two- and four-year public colleges tuition-free for all
            students. Any future student loans from the government should be
            offered at zero interest. All current student debt should be
            cancelled as part of a one-time corrective jubilee. And all
            university institutions must open their books; transparency and
            accountability to students and their families, as well as to their
            employees, is essential.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you think providing free public education sounds like pie in the
            sky, it would probably cost way less than you think. By our
            estimates, the total amount of new money necessary is
            <a href="/uncategorized/how-far-to-free/" target="_blank"
              >less than $13 billion</a
            >
            a year. That’s a lot of money, to be sure, but within the scope of
            the federal budget it is less than 0.1% of yearly spending—merely a
            rounding error. For the sake of comparison, U.S. taxpayers are
            currently subsidizing too-big-to-fail banks at the rate of
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMBloomberg" target="_blank"
              >$83 billion</a
            >
            every year. To offer another comparison, tax subsidies to just
            twelve corporations totaled about
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMUngar" target="_blank"
              >$20 billion </a
            >per year from 2008 to 2010.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until the conventional debate is opened up to include alternatives
            that genuinely reflect the needs of students and debtors, Strike
            Debt believes that the only sensible thing to do is to resist
            student debt. It is immoral, illegitimate, odious, and a drain on
            both those who must bear it and the society in which they live. We
            believe that a true grassroots movement of student debtors—the
            movement we want to be a part of—will organize a collective refusal
            to pay. When student debtors realize their collective power in this
            way, then we may suddenly find ourselves in a world where
            politicians are forced to treat education as a public good. Momentum
            is growing. Join the resistance!
