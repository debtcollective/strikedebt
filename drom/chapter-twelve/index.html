        <h1>Municipal and State Debt: Crushing Debt from Above</h1>
        <!--<article  id="post-">-->

        <article class="content">
          <p>
            As we’ve seen in previous chapters, our lives have become
            increasingly beholden to the logic of debt. It can be hard to tell
            sometimes whether something as basic as your home is first and
            foremost a place to live, or a moving piece in a real-estate shell
            game. And if you’re considering pursuing a degree, a debt-benefit
            analysis might be your first consideration when selecting your area
            of study: will you be able to find a job in your field that pays
            well enough for you to survive with the amount of debt you’ll need
            to take on? Though you may not always lose in these risky games
            we’re forced to play, it’s always a safe bet that financial
            institutions will win.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this new “financialized” way of living doesn’t just apply to
            individuals. Due to significant changes in the way we finance
            government, the towns, cities, counties, and states we live in are
            also now run according to the risky logic of debt. Banks are
            profiting at the expense of state and local governments to the
            detriment of ordinary residents. Is your city experiencing a budget
            crisis? Is your state laying off workers and cutting services? Are
            local hospitals understaffed and underfunded? Do you worry about
            whether your child’s school will have enough money to provide
            students with a quality education? If this is happening in your
            community, you are a debtor.
          </p>
          <p>
            For banks, borrowing money is easy; the federal government will give
            you as much as you want at a near-zero interest rate. Unfortunately,
            borrowing money isn’t so simple for cities and states. Reduced
            public funding and shrinking revenues have forced municipalities
            everywhere to partner with Wall Street investment banks to win
            access to credit markets, issuing bonds to pay for everything from
            basic operations, like sewers, to large developments, such as sports
            arenas. Municipalities guarantee loans by promising that investors
            will be repaid with tax dollars or revenue generated by the
            debt-funded project. Wall Street profits from those bonds through
            fees, interest payments, and “securitization,” or the packaging of
            bonds into debt bundles, which are sold and resold on the global
            market.
          </p>
          <h2 class="submenu">How We Got Here</h2>
          <p>
            It wasn’t always this way. For decades following the Great
            Depression, the federal government actively invested in social
            services and infrastructure development, and was regarded as a
            lender of last resort in a pinch. But when a world recession began
            in the 1970s, New York City became an involuntary test case for a
            new way of doing things. Powerful business and real estate interests
            had already successfully pressured the city to lower their taxes,
            shrinking revenues significantly. And just as the economy worsened
            and expenses exploded, the federal government cut support for social
            services.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a budget crisis inevitably set in, Washington withheld aid,
            signaling the beginning of a harsh new era. Other options to help
            fix New York’s budget were available—increasing the city’s low
            property taxes, for example (Moody 2007, 29). Instead, an aggressive
            coalition of city business elites who controlled access to credit
            forced harsh reforms. Budgets for education, health care, and social
            services were drastically cut. City workers were laid off or had
            their wages and benefits slashed. If a crisis arose, the needs of
            bondholders would be privileged over those of ordinary citizens.
          </p>
          <p>
            New York quickly became the model for municipal financing
            everywhere. (It also served as inspiration for the brutal treatment
            of debtor nations in the global South at the hands of the
            International Monetary Fund.) From coast to coast, cities and states
            have become completely beholden to big banks, which have imposed
            predatory lending practices similar to the ones we experience as
            individual debtors. The result is shuttered schools and libraries,
            fire departments, and endless blocks of homes in foreclosure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The federal bankruptcy code has even been revised to ensure that
            many municipal bonds will keep paying investors no matter the costs
            to communities. Bonds are supposed to be bets on the future. In most
            cases, however, there is no way the lender can lose, but cities can
            lose a great deal. According to a recent report, of 18,400 municipal
            bond issuers from 1970 to 2009,
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMCBO"
              >only 54 have dared to default</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2011, Jefferson County, Alabama, filed the largest bankruptcy in
            U.S. history to contest a $4 billion debt in the aftermath of
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMChurch" target="_blank"
              >a sewer project gone disastrously wrong</a
            >. Local officials had borrowed vast sums from Wall Street to pay
            for a treatment plant to stop sewage from flowing into the Cahaba
            River in a predominantly Black community. The project was never
            completed because corrupt officials mishandled the funds (seventeen
            have since been jailed). Lenders demanded repayment anyway, doubling
            each household’s sewer bill in a neighborhood already reeling from
            poverty. The county’s financial trauma has resulted in public
            service cuts, mass layoffs, and overcrowded prisons.
          </p>
          <h2 class="submenu">Debt Democracy: Stadiums Versus Hospitals</h2>
          <p>
            In 1997, the people of Minneapolis passed a referendum specifically
            requiring a vote before large sums could be spent on sports
            facilities. Recently, even after hundreds of thousands of dollars of
            TV ads aired pushing subsidies for a new football stadium there,
            polls showed only 22% of the public thought any tax dollars should
            be used to build one. But Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis’s
            mayor sidestepped the people, diverting city tax revenue and
            creating a new “stadium authority” not subject to referendum law to
            spend
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMFrederick" target="_blank"
              >over $300 million</a
            >
            in taxpayer money.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, Ohio’s Hamilton County—where one in seven
            residents now lives in poverty—has slashed education and social
            service budgets, and is selling off a hospital to make payments on
            $875 million in bond-financed debt they assumed in the 1990s to
            build
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMRoss" target="_blank"
              >two Cincinnati stadiums</a
            >. Whose priorities do these development decisions represent?
          </p>
          <p>
            The large-scale debt-financing of our municipal infrastructure and
            public institutions provides bankers with hefty profits at citizens’
            expense and means a smaller voice for the communities that those
            institutions are meant to serve. Taxpayers are given few
            opportunities for input as to which bonds are issued and how, and
            often they find themselves stuck with the tab for debt-funded
            projects that have no accountability to voters. City officials
            broker deals with private partners through backdoor channels, zoning
            off “development districts” or declaring parcels of land “blighted”
            so they can be seized and sold under eminent domain. Priorities
            regarding vital public services from schools to hospitals to fire
            departments are increasingly being made behind closed doors,
            according to the logic of profits.
          </p>
          <p>
            In New York, large-scale development financed with public funds and
            minimal public input is a favorite pastime of billionaire Mayor
            Bloomberg. In 2004, the rezoning of downtown Brooklyn was approved
            with virtually no opportunity for direct input from community
            members. One neighborhood in the crosshairs was the Fulton Street
            Mall—then the third most profitable retail district in the city and
            home to a wide array of small businesses, largely owned and
            frequented for generations by nearby
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMFUREE" target="_blank"
              >immigrant communities and communities of color</a
            >.The developer who won the contract to replace the mall with mostly
            luxury housing and upscale stores received $20 million of federal
            funds intended to help distressed neighborhoods, as well as
            additional city subsidies. Meanwhile, hospitals across the city
            (especially in low-income communities) are closing at an alarming
            rate.

            directly through tax revenues or with bonds that could only be
            issued with direct taxpayer approval. Since the racist war on drugs
            kicked off in the 1980s, however, prisoner populations across the
            nation have exploded. The U.S. prison population increased
            500% since 1980 (Nolan 2011, 22), and despite the fact that Black
            and Latino/a crime rates haven’t risen for decades, incarceration
            rates for drug offenses increased

            between 1980 and 2000. Legislators have been unable to win citizens’
            approval to spend massive amounts of taxpayer money on constructing
            prisons. But with

            Encouraged by eager investment bankers and construction companies,
            state governments have concocted a variety of backdoor schemes,
            borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars to fund the rapid
            expansion of prisons with little public oversight. As with sports
            arenas, a favorite scheme for undemocratically funding prisons is to
            create separate “bond-issuing authorities” that aren’t beholden to
            voter approval. Though such bonds aren’t legally backed with
            taxpayer money, the state’s credit rating is still on the line, and
            defaulting can have disastrous consequences.

            When legislators finally decided to close a notoriously abusive and
            poorly run debt-financed prison in Tallulah, Louisiana, they
            received a letter from a rating agency notifying them that breaking
            the prison’s lease could damage the state’s credit, cutting it off
            from much-needed funding. Residents demanded the site be turned into
            a learning center. Instead, Louisiana continued to pay $3.2 million
            annually, and

            incentives of debt have overridden the will of communities time and
            time again. Many states now spend more on prisons than on higher
            education. Since 1967, California has reduced funding for higher
            education by two-thirds while

          <h3>Interest rate nightmares</h3>
          <p>
            The bonds that municipalities issue require them to make regular
            payments to bondholders. Often, payment amounts vary based on
            current interest rates, which can strain municipal budgets when
            rates suddenly jump up. But sometime in the 1990s, banks came up
            with a fancy way to convert municipalities’ fluctuating interest
            rates to more predictable fixed rates—all for a fee, of course.
            These deals were called “interest rate swaps,” and they sold like
            hotcakes—$500 billion worth of hotcakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a swap, the municipality was guaranteed that if interest rates
            exceeded a fixed percentage, the bank would pay the excess, while if
            rates dipped below this percentage, the municipality owed the bank.
            This was all fine when interest rates actually fluctuated, but since
            the 2008 crash, rates for bonds have remained incredibly low,
            hovering around 2%. And banks are still demanding that towns,
            states, school districts, utilities, and other bond issuers pay them
            back at the much higher rates set by swaps before the crash. The
            only way out for cities is costly “termination payments.” So far,
            our communities have paid over $4 billion to banks like Citigroup,
            JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America to get out of
            these lousy deals. Not long ago, when these same banks were
            teetering on the brink, the government bailed them out with
            taxpayers’ money to the tune of over $15 trillion.

            Public transit agencies from Boston to Los Angeles have been hit
            especially hard by poisonous swaps. In NYC, the Metropolitan
            Transportation Authority (MTA) has so far lost $600 million. Rather
            than refuse payment, the MTA has cut service and laid off thousands
            of workers. Most people who rely on the subway are working class New
            Yorkers, including many people of color, immigrants, and disabled
            folks. The MTA passes these illegitimate debts onto riders through

          <p>
            As if all that weren’t enough, we’ve recently learned that many of
            the world’s largest banks have been manipulating a key interest rate
            known as Libor (The London Interbank Offered Rate). Calculated
            daily, Libor is based on how much interest banks charge when loaning
            money to each other. It is then in turn used to set rates for over
            $800 trillion of investments around the world, including many forms
            of consumer credit and—you guessed it—municipal interest rate swaps.
            It turns out banks have been reporting false data, intentionally
            pushing Libor up or down to capitalize on particular trades. It’s
            anyone’s guess as to how many billions of dollars have been stolen,
            but anyone with a pension or a home or auto loan was likely
            affected. It’s estimated that municipalities in the United States
            have paid over $6 billion in fraudulent interest and fees due to
            artificially lowered Libor data, including cities like Baltimore,
            where more than

            Wall Street’s criminality reveals that there is no such thing as a
            free market and never was. In his exposé on municipal bond rigging
            (which he calls “the scam Wall Street learned from the mafia”), Matt
            Taibbi explained that Wall Street “skimmed untold billions” from
            hundreds of municipalities. After they were caught, banks continued
            investing in city bonds. “Get busted for welfare fraud even once in
            America, and good luck getting so much as a food stamp ever again,”
            Taibbi wrote. “Get caught rigging interest rates in 50 states, and
            the government goes right on handing you

          <p>
            With a problem as structural and deeply ingrained as municipal or
            state debt, it’s hard to imagine changing the system by yourself.
            The good news is that people across the planet have begun organizing
            in myriad ways to demand that their towns, cities, and states are no
            longer run according to the logic of debt, but for the benefit of
            the people who live there. Tactics run the gamut from local direct
            actions to completely reimagining the banking system. Strike Debt is
            proud to be part of this global movement.

            Just after the financial crisis set in here in New York, a group
            called the People’s Transportation Program, inspired by the
            community “survival programs” of the Black Panthers, set out to buy
            subway fare cards in bulk and give away as many
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMDunn" target="_blank">free rides</a>
            as they could swipe through in a day. By their math, for every $75
            spent on one-day passes, they could give away over $1,000 worth of
            rides, keeping money in their communities that might otherwise have
            gone to banks as

            March 2013. In July 2012, Boston activists held subway turnstiles
            open to protest Wall Street’s

            on their city’s transportation budget. Is the transit system in your

            Many communities are organizing lawsuits and legislation to push

            Other approaches are aimed at changing the very nature of finance.
            Many have looked to public banking as a way to fund our
            municipalities without relying on Wall Street. North Dakota, the
            only state in the union with a public banking system, has posted
            budget surpluses every year since the 2008 crisis began and boasts
            the nation’s
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMBrown2" target="_blank"
              >lowest unemployment rate</a
            >. Their bank was established in 1919 to empower farmers against big
            banks and make sure tax revenues were reinvested locally.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea is relatively simple: All state revenues are deposited in
            the bank and interest on loans is returned to the community rather
            than handed to a far-away lender. North Dakota’s bank makes stable,
            low-interest credit available for infrastructure projects and
            emergency aid, enabling municipalities to avoid the municipal bond
            trap. It’s also further strengthened the local economy by providing
            credit for small businesses and green energy projects. Bills have
            been introduced in seventeen states to start public banks, but it’s
            an uphill battle: The banking industry is doing its best to
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMAnderson" target="_blank"
              >prevent</a

            public banking from catching on.

          <p>
            It’s certainly possible that different financial and legal
            structures could help fix our budgets, but the only way to truly
            defend ourselves against a system that values profits over people is
            to have real democratic control over our towns, cities, states, and
            lives. And maybe it’s time to start imagining what a world without
            profits could look like. At the very least, we must insist that
            banks no longer write the laws dictating how our communities are
            financed, and that the public has not just a review or an “input,”
            but the power to decide how public resources are used. Over thirty
            years ago, the city of Porto Allegre in Brazil pioneered a process
            called “participatory budgeting” that directly involves citizens in
            determining priorities for municipal spending. It’s since been used
            in over three hundred cities across the world, though only two small
            districts in New York and Chicago have

            But the idea that some debts can and should be refused is a
            sentiment that’s spreading. In Europe, the rallying cry of the
            anti-austerity movement has become “we won’t pay for your crisis!”
            Groups from Spain to Tunisia are performing “citizen’s audits” of
            their governments and financial institutions, deciding for
            themselves

              >which debts are legitimate, and which should be abolished</a
            >. Have you ever looked at your town budget? Do you know how your
            elected and non-elected officials fund public works? Who benefits?
            Who really ends up paying for what? Simply posing these questions in
            your community is an important first step toward striking debt!
