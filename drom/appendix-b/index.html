          <p>
            I have recently been informed that there is negative information
            reported by [name of bank] in the file [ChexSystems/TeleCheck]
            maintains under my Social Security number. Upon ordering a copy of
            the report, I see an entry from this bank listing a “[condition,
            e.g., NSF, overdraft, account abuse]” in [month] [year].
          </p>
          <p>
            I am unaware of ever having a “[same condition]” from this bank.
            Please validate this information with [name of bank] and provide me
            with copies of any documentation associated with this “[same
            condition]” bearing my signature. In the absence of any such
            documentation, I ask that this information be immediately deleted
            from the file you maintain under my Social Security number.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have 30 days to verify this information and to provide me with a
            document bearing my original signature. If you cannot, I am
            demanding removal under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            This report is <i>severely</i> restricting my banking abilities.
          </p>
          <p>My contact information is as follows:</p>

          <p>
            This letter is in response to your recent claim that [name of bank]
            has verified this account to be mine. Yet again, you have failed to
            provide me with a copy of any viable evidence submitted by [name of
            bank]. Be advised that the description of the procedure used to
            determine the accuracy and completeness of the information is hereby
            requested, to be provided within fifteen (15) days of the completion
            of your reinvestigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, please provide the name, address, and telephone number
            of each person contacted at [name of bank] regarding this alleged
            account. I am formally requesting a copy of any documents provided
            by [name of bank]. If [name of bank] does not validate the debt, it
            is a violation of the FCRA [611 [15 U.S.C. § 1681i] a 6 B iii:
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
            “a notice that, if requested by the consumer, a description of the
            procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the
            information shall be provided to the consumer by the agency,
            including the business name and address of any furnisher of
            information contacted in connection with such information and the
            telephone number of such furnisher, if reasonably available.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The listed item is entirely inaccurate and incomplete, and
            represents a very serious error in your reporting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Failure to comply with federal regulations by credit reporting
            agencies is investigated by the Federal Trade Commission (see 15
            U.S.C. § 41). I am maintaining a careful record of my communications
            with you for the purpose of filing a complaint with the FTC and the
            State Attorney General’s office, should you continue in your
            noncompliance.

          <p>
            As I have not heard back from you in over [15/30/45] days regarding
            my notice of dispute dated [date letter was sent], I must presume
            that no proof in fact exists.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are currently in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your failure to respond, in writing, hand signed, and in a timely
            manner, will work as a waiver to any and all of your claims in this
            matter, and will entitle me to presume that you are reporting my
            name and Social Security number in error, and that this matter is
            permanently closed. Remove me from your records immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Failure to respond within 30 days of receipt of this certified
            letter will result in a small claims action against your company. I
            will be seeking a minimum of $5,000 in damages for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Defamation</li>
            <li>Negligent enablement of identity fraud</li>
            <li>Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For the purposes of 15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq., this notice has the
            same effect as a dispute to the validity of the alleged debt and a
            dispute to the validity of your claims. This notice is an attempt to

            This is a formal notice of dispute regarding information that [name
            of bank] sent to [ChexSystems/TeleCheck], a consumer reporting
            agency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following false information was sent to [ChexSystems/TeleCheck]:

            This information was disputed with [ChexSystems/TeleCheck] on
            [date]; however, [Name of bank] verified the information as
            accurate. This falsely reported information damages my financial
            reputation and should be removed immediately.
          </p>
          <p>

            Under my rights under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act,

          <p>To whom it may concern:</p>
          <p>
            This letter is regarding account # [xxxx-xxx], which you claim
            [condition, e.g., “I owe $100.00”]. This is a formal notice that
            your claim is disputed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am requesting validation, made pursuant to the Fair Debt
            Collection Practices Act. Please note that I am requesting
            “validation”; that is, competent evidence bearing my signature,
            showing that I have, or ever had, some contractual obligation to pay
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please also be aware that any negative mark found on my credit
            reports, including [ChexSystems/TeleCheck], from your company or any
            company that you represent for a debt that I do not owe is a
            violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Therefore if you cannot
            validate the debt, you must request that all credit reporting
            agencies delete the entry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pending the outcome of my investigation of any evidence that you
            submit, you are instructed to take no action that could be
            detrimental to any of my credit reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Failure to respond within 30 days of receipt of this certified
            letter will result in legal action against your company. I will be
            seeking a minimum of $5,000 in damages for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Defamation</li>
            <li>Negligent enablement of identity fraud</li>
            <li>Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act</li>

            For the purposes of 15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq., this notice has the
            same effect as a dispute to the validity of the alleged debt and a
            dispute to the validity of your claims. This notice is an attempt to
