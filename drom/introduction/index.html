        <h1>Debt Rules Everything Around Me</h1>
        <!--<article  id="post-">-->

        <article class="content">
          <p>
            Everyone is affected by debt, from people taking out payday loans at
            400% interest to cover basic living costs, to recent graduates
            paying hundreds of dollars in interest on their students loans every
            month, to working families bankrupted by medical bills, to elders
            living in “underwater” homes, to the teachers and firefighters
            forced to take pay cuts because their cities are broke, to people in
            the global South suffering due to their countries being pushed into
            austerity and poverty by structural adjustment programs. Everyone
            seems to owe something, and most of us are in so deep it’ll be years
            before we have any chance of getting out—if we have any chance at
            all. But few of us are asking, “Who do we all owe this money to,
            anyway?” and “Where did they get the money they lent?”
          </p>
          <h2 class="submenu">To Whom are We Indebted?</h2>
          <p>
            Even among people drowning in debt, typical conversations around the
            subject are framed in terms of personal responsibility: the debtors
            have no one to blame but themselves for getting into this situation,
            and moreover, to not pay one’s debts is an act of blasphemy, shame,
            and dishonor. To default is to expose one’s callous disregard for
            all that is decent. Today, morality is bound to debt—the two are
            inextricably linked. When we dispose of all the jargon attached to
            credit and debt, we can see that at its core, a loan is essentially
            a bet on whether or not that person—the debtor—will make good on
            their word. It is a risk, and that risk is higher or lower depending
            on that person’s status in society (defined only in the most narrow
            economic terms). A debt represents the willingness and ability of
            one to keep their promise. But a person’s actual ability to repay is
            often out of their hands. Frequently it depends on powers beyond
            their control. Debt further distorts our basic perceptions of
            ourselves and others; not only is a person’s word on the line, but
            also their value as a human being. In a way, we invest the value we
            place on ourselves into that credit arrangement and into our
            relationship with debt. We measure how and who we are as a human
            being and then bet on our trustworthiness, our character. The
            subprime mortgage crisis is a particularly egregious example of
            moralistic victim-blaming. Subprime mortgages were concentrated in
            areas with higher racial segregation and targeted people of color,
            yet some people blamed the victims of this financial disaster, often
            with racialized language, proclaiming that, “those people shouldn’t
            have borrowed so much.” Arguments such as these, however, ignore the
            whole history of the exclusion of people of color from mainstream
            financial opportunities that could have led to homeownership. In
            addition, when many people of color finally got access to credit
            through legislative reforms, the lending was often predatory in
            nature. The effects of the subprime mortgage crisis and the
            subsequent credit crisis resulted in the further degradation of
            debtors’ social status. Edmund Andrews, the former economics
            correspondent at the<i> New York Times</i>, tied the issue together
            quite well when he reflected on his own credit troubles: “to see
            yourself plunged down to being a debtor, the likes of which are
            being made fun of all over the place—it’s just an awful experience”
            (Sington 2011). This statement makes clear what many already feel
            (and fear): the debtor is seen as <i>subordinate</i> or somehow
            <i>of less value</i> than a non-debtor. This is unfortunately held
            as a near-universal belief and many people are socially and
            economically excluded because of it. Debt warps the way we look at
            each other and encourages us to evaluate one another through a
            financial lens. Debt serves as a way to classify people, to put them
            into hierarchies, and to separate and isolate them in the process.
            Most of us have been brought up in a society where we are
            conditioned to hold these beliefs dearly, and on the surface it all
            sounds reasonable. If you take out a loan, you are obligated to pay
            it back. Focusing on debt at the individual level is a common
            approach. However, it is insufficient for understanding debt
            <i>as a system</i> and understanding why one would be right in
            resisting it. We have to go deeper by examining the terrain on a
            structural level and explore the circumstances that have put people
            (and municipalities and entire countries) into debt.

          <p>
            Over three-quarters of us have some type of personal debt. At least
            14% of people living in the United States are already being pursued
            by debt collectors, which is

            from a decade ago. Are so many people <i>really</i> so reckless, so
            irresponsible? Granted, total household debt has been on the decline
            since 2008, but it is nevertheless still sitting at a whopping

            >
            over the past decade and a half. Contrary to popular misconceptions,
            debt cannot simply be explained as the consequence of financially
            irresponsible individuals acquiring luxurious items beyond their
            means. Instead it is quite typically the outcome of people and
            families just trying to survive under capitalism. Forty percent of
            indebted U.S. households use credit cards to cover basic living
            costs such as rent, food, and utilities, and nearly half of indebted
            households

            due to medical costs. Indeed, we are told to consume to stimulate
            the economy and are subsequently demonized for accruing debt. In the
            wake of any financial blip or disaster, politicians often implore
            people to spend money for the sake of economic growth (remember that
            then-mayor Giuliani’s advice to New Yorkers after 9/11 was to go
            shopping). After the financial crash, however, we were told that we
            spent <i>too much</i>. According to a Consumer Reports survey in
            2009, over half of the respondents paid off credit card bills each
            month. The remaining people accrued debt not by living large, but
            mostly by

            of irresponsibility, stating, “the underlying reason behind some
            households having higher levels of credit card debt than other
            households was the occurrence of unforeseen events, such as job
            loss, medical expenses, or car breakdowns.” There are myriad factors
            that explain these circumstances, but a good place to start is by
            looking at economic trends over the past four and a half decades.

            has contributed to a steep rise in precarious work—insecure jobs
            with low wages and no benefits (Fudge and Owens 2006<em>,</em>
            3-28). As any wage laborer knows, the power exercised over them in
            the workplace is sometimes absolute. But in today’s unstable
            economy, where it’s common to hear of people working more than one
            part-time job without benefits, often just finding and keeping a job
            is a huge struggle. Today, even the ability to find a job can be
            determined by one’s debt. Employers can view your credit reports to
            determine whether or not you are “responsible,” and therefore
            “employable.” In other words, prospective employers look to see
            whether or not your personal circumstances will affect your work or
            if you have a history of being “financially imprudent.” Credit
            scores are often the determining factor, and more will be discussed

            income gap. Wage stagnation means people in the United States are
            finding it harder and harder to afford basic necessities, so they
            turn to credit cards and end up paying even more through high
            interest rates. As Kelly Gates observes, “The consumer credit
            industry exploded at precisely the time when social welfare programs
            were being dismantled and wages were stagnating for large numbers of
            people, with consumer credit filling the widening gap between the
            wages people earned and the personal expenses they accumulated in
            the new economy” (Gates 2010, 427). As the evidence demonstrates,
            the situation is often even harder—due to income gaps and a host of
            other factors which are in turn a result of structural
            oppression—for people who are not White, male, able-bodied,
            cisgender, or straight.

          <h3>Looking beyond income inequality</h3>
          <p>
            Income alone, however, does not illustrate the gravity of the
            situation. It is more accurate to discuss wealth, or net worth—the
            amount someone owns minus the amount that they owe. After all, the

            stripped away during the Great Recession due to the dominant role of
            home equity in their wealth portfolios and the prevalence of
            predatory high-risk loans in communities of color. The Latino

              >67% of its total wealth</a

            during the housing collapse.” The particularly severe impact of
            economic inequality on Black and Latino/a people can be attributed
            to a long history of structural racism that continues to exist in
            the form of, among other things, redlining (the denial of loans or
            insurance to people of color) and reverse redlining (aggressively
            targeting communities of color with predatory services). Discussing
            income exclusively is also insufficient when talking about debt as
            it relates to age. Recently, a new type of loan targeting the
            elderly known as pension advances has emerged. People sign over
            their pension checks to companies in exchange for cash, but with
            interest rates that

            >. People with a fixed income, such as those on Social Security, can
            barely keep up with skyrocketing costs of living, but they’re still
            viewed as a golden goose by creditors. The problem goes deeper than
            stagnant wages. While stagnation has contributed greatly to people’s
            inability to get by and caused them to accrue debt, simply raising
            wages would not prove to be an adequate solution. Namely, this would
            ignore those <i>without</i> wages in the first place, including
            <a

            as worthy of a wage, and the many kinds of vital labor that have
            long been unpaid—labor that is done to create and maintain our lives
            and to produce and sustain a workforce for profit-seeking
            enterprises. This work,
            <i>when performed for one’s own family </i>and which includes child
            bearing and rearing, cooking, cleaning, and elder care, is often
            referred to as “housework.” Some feminists call it “reproductive
            labor” (Federici and Cox 2012, 36). (As women in wealthier countries
            enter the paid workforce in larger numbers, others, primarily
            immigrant women, are paid a measly sum to perform this domestic
            work—either in addition to or at the expense of performing housework
            for their own families.) It’s the invisible work that makes
            “traditional work”—that is, waged labor—possible. Caring for others
            has traditionally been deemed “women’s work”—something which women
            are supposedly naturally inclined to do for their own fulfillment.
            This, it could be argued, has a lot to do with why this labor
            remains largely unwaged and undervalued. The fact that some men
            perform reproductive labor doesn’t change the fact that it’s still
            dismissed as “women’s work” and valued accordingly. If the
            contribution of this work to the economy sounds negligible, imagine
            what would happen if those performing reproductive labor

              >went on strike</a
            >. Any conversations about the relationship between wages and debt
            need to take into account the very nature of waged labor itself.
            There are other forms of unwaged labor as well, including modern day
            slavery. The issue of unfree prison labor also requires our
            attention. Global capitalism “thrives on the unwaged labor of
            millions of women and men in the fields, kitchens, and prisons of
            the United States and throughout the world” (Federici and Cox 2012,
            31). To demand an increase in the minimum wage would benefit a large
            segment of the U.S. population, but the situation would be unchanged
            for most wageless workers.

            Livable wages for <i>all</i> workers—including those who do not
            conform to conventional notions of “workers”—would be a necessary
            first step toward freeing ourselves from the debt system. But this
            approach, too, appears insufficient. We have to ask ourselves: is
            our economic system adequately meeting people’s needs and desires,
            or do we need to consider other ways of structuring a society? It is
            under capitalism, after all, that corporations are obligated
            <i>by law </i>to maximize profits. Unsurprisingly, then, corporate
            profits as a percentage of national income are the highest since

            ability to lead dignified lives all on their own, though;
            legislators and politicians are complicit. Only recently did it
            surface that taxpayers subsidize big banks around

            ignored “systemic risk,” or the interconnectedness of the financial
            system. This muddles the central problem: the problem is systemic
            because the problem <i>is</i> the system. We know that those who
            plan and profit from capitalism need us, but do we need them? An
            analysis of debt is becoming increasingly relevant in the fight for
            justice. Economic exploitation and oppression exist not only in the
            workplace. Through debt we feel this exploitation in nearly all
            facets of our lives, from the houses we live in to the schools we
            attend to the hospitals we rely upon. Yet the exploitation is often
            subtler, and therefore debt requires more careful attention. As will
            be demonstrated throughout this book, all aspects of the debt system
            maintain and exacerbate already existing social inequalities, in the

            increase in refugee populations, and the death of millions of
            people, to name just a few horrific consequences of living under a
            global system that dictates paying one’s debts is more important
            than life itself (Federici 2012, 84).

            Debt as a social relationship, a weapon, and a form of control
          </h3>
          <p>
            People may feel like most kinds of debt—sometimes<i> including</i>
            their own personal debts—are far removed from their lives or that
            they are too abstract to understand. More often than not, technical
            terms surrounding debt serve to confuse and scare people rather than
            educate and empower them. In the past, debt and the language
            employed in its discussion have been used not only as a way to
            divide those “in the know” from the rest, but also as tools of
            control and discipline in order to limit and direct people’s life
            choices. Debt is a profoundly effective form of social control, and,
            as many have argued, it has become
            <a
              title="“The Politics of Debt in America”"
              href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMFraser"
              target="_blank"
              >the primary form</a
            >
            of extracting and accumulating wealth for the rich. Debt affects
            nearly every part of our lives. Not only does it determine the
            material possessions in our lives, but it also shapes our psyches.
            Debt is not something that exists outside of us, but rather
            something that is central in forming our identities, characters, and
            our relationships. As demonstrated earlier, debt is used as an
            oppressive financial tool that entangles class, race, gender,
            sexuality, age, and ability. It exploits members of marginalized
            groups, plunging them further into hardship. It is a strategy that
            impoverishes people and serves as a stark reminder of the power
            differences in our society. Though the effects of debt are felt
            across the social spectrum, debt does not “equalize” or make
            oppression uniform. But as a form of control, it does force us to
            have similar, sometimes shared, experiences, all of which define our
            self-perceptions and our relationships with our neighbors. Perhaps
            the most notable aspect of debt is the asymmetry in power. Creditors
            and Wall Street banks use financial markets, the power of the legal
            system, and the power that comes with having political and economic
            clout to accumulate staggering amounts of money. Preserving these
            privileged positions demands that they issue credit and create vast
            populations of debtors, from whom they gain commission, interest,
            and ultimately profit. This profit, like all profit, comes at a
            cost. Not only is our labor the source of much, if not all, of their
            revenue, but they also rob us of our future by demanding we work
            <i>more</i> to pay for ever-increasing interest rates that balloon
            if we miss payment. Beholden to these financial institutions,
            debtors are pushed to become complacent laborers. Of course, no one
            should begrudge people for trying to make ends meet or provide for
            their families, but what this relationship also deprives us of is an
            imagination of a world outside the creditor-debtor relationship. The
            ideas and experiences that fuel our imagination diminish, and it
            becomes harder to fight for a better, more just world. As a weapon,
            debt determines where we live, where and how we work, as well as our
            mental health. From a young age, we are conditioned to feel that
            being in debt is shameful and worthy of punishment. To offer a
            particularly poignant example, recently students at a middle school
            in Massachusetts were deprived of eating cafeteria food for having
            as a little as five cents of debt on their
            <a

              target="_blank"
              >prepaid cards</a
            >. The lesson is clear: debtors, no matter their age or
            circumstances, don’t deserve to have their basic needs met. In
            addition to being socially ostracized, debtors suffer from
            psychological problems that often go unnoticed. Although there is
            strikingly little research in the United States about debt’s impact
            on mental health, there are whole message boards filled with people
            citing their debt as a source of their depression. We also see an
            increasing number of people in the United States

            >
            are common among debtors, as well as insomnia, anxiety, and a slew
            of physical and psychological illnesses. These harmful effects can
            be amplified in an unstable economic climate such as today’s. As if
            ushering us from one point in our lives to another, debt acts as
            both a deterrent and catalyst. As a tool of capitalism that is used
            intentionally to extract wealth from people, debt forces us to take
            more than one job and to quit school or the things that give us an
            identity outside of work. Low-income students are more likely to
            rely on loans to afford college. Faced with skyrocketing tuition,
            these same students sometimes have to work many jobs to cover the
            costs. This forces students to compromise their studies in order to
            work, which affects their achievements and ultimately

              >perpetuates class divisions</a
            >. Debt is also used to shape certain attitudes, behaviors, ideas,
            and actions. For instance, the criminal justice system is seeing a
            dramatic rise in the number of indigent, or poor, individuals who
            are incarcerated because of their debt. Once in prison, harsh
            measures dictate prisoners’ entire lives, while simultaneously their
            forced manual labor floods our economy with cheap goods and
            commodities. Although debtors’ prisons were outlawed in the United
            States long ago, people are still imprisoned because they can’t
            afford to pay fines for what are sometimes minor infractions. Once
            in the criminal justice system, people are burdened with more fees
            that they cannot pay, driving them further into debt. Prisons are
            continually filled with impoverished people, giving life to a cycle
            of poverty and imprisonment that is hard to escape (<i

          <h2 class="submenu">About Strike Debt</h2>
          <p>
            This operations manual is written by an anonymous collective from
            Strike Debt. For over a year now, Strike Debt has been part of an
            international debt resistance movement—developing tactics,
            resources, and frameworks for expanding the fight against the debt
            system while developing alternative systems based on mutual aid.
            Strike Debt emerged in New York City as an offshoot of Occupy Wall
            Street in the wake of May Day 2012, receiving a great deal of
            inspiration from the student strikes in Québec happening at the
            time. We soon expanded to organize around <i>all</i> forms of debt.
            Chapters began popping up all over the country, including in
            Philadelphia, Denver, Boston, the Bay Area, Chicago, and Raleigh.
            The group operates under many principles that were adopted by Occupy
            participants from other nonhierarchical movements across the world.
            These principles include political autonomy, direct democracy,
            direct action, a culture of solidarity, and a commitment to
            combating all forms of oppression. As we intend to demonstrate in
            this book, Strike Debt believes that debt binds us all—though it
            binds some people (people of color, queer and trans people, women,
            people with disabilities, and the poor) more tightly than others. In
            addition to the creation of this manual, Strike Debt has organized a
            number of initiatives and actions, such as the Rolling Jubilee. The
            Rolling Jubilee purchases debt on the secondary market for
            approximately 1–5% of the original principal and subsequently
            abolishes it. Other Strike Debt projects involve debt education,
            hosting debtors’ assemblies, offering free health care, and
            protesting hospital closings.
          </p>
          <h3>About this manual</h3>
          <p>
            The Debt Resisters’ Operations Manual (DROM) seeks to provide widely
            applicable yet detailed information about debt as well as strategies
            for resistance. It highlights our commonalities—namely, that people
            are not alone in their struggles against debt—as well as our
            different relationships to debt. We strive to analyze debt from many
            different angles, always maintaining a nuanced, critical analysis
            that is conscious of race, gender, class, sexuality, age, ability,
            and their intersections. We strive to write in simple language and
            will work to translate the manual into languages other than English.
            A 120-page pamphlet version of the manual was collectively
            researched and written in August 2012 as a contribution to
            strengthening and expanding the debt resistance movement. Following
            its release in September 2012, over twelve thousand copies were
            printed and distributed for free within two months, from New York to
            Portland to Chicago to New Orleans. Digital versions were read by
            tens of thousands more people. In order to reach out to a wider
            audience and encourage more acts of debt resistance (and to avoid
            accruing more debt ourselves through printing and distribution
            costs!), we decided to expand the breadth of issues we covered in
            the pamphlet and publish this book with Common Notions and PM Press.
            Although this edition is sold online and in bookstores, we are
            committed to making the contents of the DROM available for free to
            anyone who might need them. In both the earlier pamphlet and this
            book, a decision was made to not attach any individual names to this
            manual. This decision is rooted in our principle of collectivity. A
            large collective of people from all over the country were directly
            involved in the researching, writing and editing of this book, but
            moreover, this manual is an attempt to reflect, and explore further,
            the endless conversations that have happened within Strike Debt over
            the past year. Whether it’s collectively developing an analysis of
            debt as a form of social control or contemplating particular
            strategies to resisting various forms of debt at meetings, countless
            people have made essential contributions to the content of this
            manual in both direct and indirect ways. People in and out of Strike
            Debt were invited to participate in creating this book as much as
            they desired in various capacities—as a researcher, writer, editor,
            coordinator, or various other roles. We also relied on input from
            the larger Strike Debt group in determining what concepts and
            tactics should be included in this manual. To ensure the group
            remained democratic, contributors of the manual reached consensus on
            decisions that affected the overall tone or structure of the book,
            such as the table of contents, the book description, and a style
            guide to inform each chapter. Meanwhile, researchers and writers of
            a particular chapter coordinated amongst themselves, while taking
            into consideration concerns raised by other members. As stated in
            the original preface, the DROM is a collective, living document; it
            remains open to revision and we invite constructive, critical
            dialogue. From the original preface:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              We don’t claim to have all or even most of the answers regarding
              debt. To produce this manual, we have reached out to our networks
              to the best of our ability. Some sections barely scratch the
              surface and in fact deserve their own book-length treatment.
              Researching debt has uncovered many connections we didn’t expect,
              and we know there are types of debt we haven’t addressed. It is
              our hope that readers will have their own strategies to contribute
              to future versions of this manual. . . . Any ideas, plans, tips,
              corrections, resources, schemes—legal or otherwise—should be sent
              to DROM@riseup.net.

            Since September 2012, we have received a tremendous amount of
            feedback from fellow debt resisters as well as lawyers, accountants,
            and other experts, and we have done our best to incorporate those
            suggestions into this edition. We have expanded upon each of the

          <h2 class="submenu">A General Outline, Chapter by Chapter</h2>
          <p>
            Talking about debt is difficult not only because it elicits raw,
            emotional responses, but also because it’s a complex and intricate
            subject. On top of this, each chapter of this book tries to provide
            you with pragmatic ways to fight back. This can be anything from
            going through strategic bankruptcy to legal action to living off the
            financial grid entirely. So, in order to avoid confusing the reader
            any more than they already have been confused by credit card
            companies or student loan servicers, we have tried to make this
            manual as accessible as possible. We guide the reader from the
            “micro” forms of debt to the “macro,” or in other words, the types
            of debt people directly experience everyday to the more abstract
            forms of debt that people think about less, but nonetheless affect
            their everyday life. This manual begins, then, with one of the
            manifestations of debt, of which many people are aware: credit
            reporting agencies and credit scores (<a
              title="Chapter One. Credit Scores and Consumer Reporting Agencies: Surveillance and the Vicious Cycle of Debt"
              href="/drom/chapter-one/"
              target="_blank"
              ><i>Chapter One</i></a
            >). In the first chapter we explain the role of credit reporting
            agencies (CRAs) and credit scores in people’s lives. In
            <a
              title="Chapter Two. Credit Card and Automobile Debt: On the Road to Nowhere"

              >Chapter Two</a
            >
            we move on to credit card debt and automobile debt—two of the most
            common forms of consumer debt. In this chapter we briefly explain
            the history and role of credit cards, as well as provide a wider
            explanation as to why so many people are reliant on credit to
            survive. Cars are the primary means by which most people travel, yet
            most households cannot purchase and maintain them without incurring

            by mortgagees to profit from low-income individuals’ misfortunes. We

            want to live without using any of the financial services mentioned
            in the rest of the manual, we have provided some strategies to
            living in the margins of this exploitative system. Municipal and

            lives.

            strict divide in the balance of wealth and power. This all paints a
            pretty bleak picture, but it is not one without hope. The final

            collective problems this manual addresses and invites you, the
            reader, to critically engage with the questions we ask in order
            build a grassroots debtors’ movement. Prospects for Change features
            just some examples of successful debt resistance throughout the
            world, and there are more to come. We try, and will keep trying, to
            imagine a world free of exploitation, white supremacy, patriarchy,
            and all other forms of oppression that set so many of us against
            each other. We encourage you to pass this book on to your friends,
            neighbors, members of your community, and coworkers. We see this
            book and the knowledge it collects as a tool that can be used to
            resist the debt system that oppresses us. To come back to the
            original question of “To whom are we indebted?” we should say that
            not all debt is bad. We are indebted to our friends and communities
            who raise us, support us, and give us strength and a sense of
            belonging and identity. Some debts keep up relations—important
            relations that help us survive and make us human. There are many
            factors that make certain debts immoral, however, like exploitation,
            force, violence, or profiteering. To the financial establishment of
            the world, we have only one thing to say: we owe you nothing. To our
            friends, our families, our communities, to humanity and to the
            natural world that makes our lives possible: we owe you everything.
            Every dollar we take from a fraudulent subprime mortgage speculator,
            every dollar we withhold from the collection agency is a tiny piece
            of our own lives and freedom that we can give back to our
            communities, to those we love and respect. These are acts of debt
            resistance, which come in many other forms as well: fighting for
            free education and health care, defending foreclosed homes against
            eviction, demanding higher wages, and practicing mutual aid. The
            late (and not-so-great) British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
            offered the world a stubborn acronym in defense of global capitalism
            and the free market: TINA, there is no alternative. There are
            ceaseless attempts to force us to believe this, to distrust others
            and keep our heads down, to discredit our collective visions of
            another society, and to keep our dreams at bay. Witness the ongoing
            militarization of society, the increase in police and state
            repression, and the controlling of dissent in this country and
            others around the world. Meanwhile, defenses of free market
            capitalism continue to be made with straight faces by pundits and
            sycophants as our economic system seems to be on the brink of
            collapse. Through the lens of debt, this book humbly offers a
            challenge to the logic of TINA, to this assault on the radical
            imagination. Another world is not only possible, but necessary.
