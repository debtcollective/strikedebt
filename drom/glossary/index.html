              President Obama’s health care reform law signed in 2010, parts of
              which go into effect in 2014. The law has the stated intent of
              making health care more affordable, although at least 23 million
              people will remain uninsured. It has been criticized for widely
              expanding the role of private health insurance and for-profit
              care, rapidly transferring public money to private hands through
              the individual mandate. Also referred to as the Patient Protection
              and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or Obamacare. See

            <dd>
              One of the two main chapters in the federal bankruptcy code under
              which individuals may file, Chapter 7 wipes away all consumer,
              medical, and other unsecured debts, but does not discharge certain
              tax debts, student loan debt, or debt from alimony and child
              support obligations.

            <dt>Chapter 13 bankruptcy</dt>
            <dd>
              One of the two main chapters in the federal bankruptcy code under
              which individuals may file, Chapter 13 emphasizes the
              restructuring of an individual’s debts as opposed to outright
              dismissal, allowing the debtor a chance to retain some important
              assets.

            <dt>Check-cashing outlet (CCO)</dt>
            <dd>

            </dd>
            <dt>Climate change</dt>
            <dd>
              Severe and sudden changes in the earth’s atmosphere and weather
              patterns brought about by human activity. Although technically the
              earth’s climate is constantly changing over vast periods of time,
              drastic increases in greenhouse gas emissions over the past two
              centuries have had unprecedented and profound impacts on the
              planet, and thus the term “climate change” primarily refers to
              human-induced changes.
            </dd>
            <dt>Climate debt</dt>
            <dd>
              Originally known as “carbon debt,” the term “climate debt” refers
              to a measureable ecological obligation from the world’s wealthiest
              countries to the global South, calculated with the understanding
              that the former are responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions,
              while the latter tends to suffer the harshest consequences.
              Contrasted with the monetary debts imposed by the richest nations,
              the concept of climate debt challenges conventional assumptions
              regarding who owes what to whom.
            </dd>

              A document produced by a credit reporting agency (CRA) summarizing
              a person’s credit history. Information in credit reports factors
              critically in decisions to grant credit (e.g., mortgage loans,
              auto loans, credit cards, and private student loans) and in other
              financial spheres, including eligibility for rental housing,

              financial information­ such as credit card balances, payment
              history, and outstanding student loan debt and then sell this
              information to banks and other creditors. Increasingly, this

              A number produced by inputting a person’s credit information from
              their credit report into a proprietary algorithm. Credit reporting
              agencies (CRAs) generate this number and provide it to banks or
              other financing companies, which use it to decide whether to lend
              to someone, and at what interest rate. Scores have different
              ranges, the most common one being 300 to 850, with a higher number
              signifying greater “creditworthiness.” Increasingly, credit scores
              are used in other major decisions besides lending, such as
              employment and housing. See <b>credit report</b> and

            <dt>FICO score</dt>
            <dd>
              The most common type of credit score. Credit reporting agencies
              (CRAs) calculate this score by taking financial data about a
              consumer and plugging it into an algorithm created by the Fair
              Isaac Corporation (hence the name “FICO score”). This algorithm is
              proprietary and secret. The score’s range is 300 to 850, and the
              median score is about 720. If someone’s score is above the median,
              they will likely have access to the best credit terms. About 20%
              of the U.S. population does not have a FICO score because there is
              not enough information in their credit report, which has a
              negative impact on their ability to get loans. The majority of
              lending decisions in the United States are made using the FICO
              score. See <b>credit reporting agencies (CRAs)</b> and

            <dd>
              A particular practice of lending where loans are not given to
              isolated individuals, but to each person in a “solidarity group,”
              often women, in order to finance a small business venture. The
              members of the group are collectively responsible to make the
              recipient pay the loan back to the bank. This use of social
              pressure to achieve high payback rates has been justified as an
              alternative to the usurious practices of moneylenders in poor
              communities all over the world.

              A form of capitalism that claims that what had previously been
              done by the state or through cooperative social action would be
              better done by capitalist firms competing in the marketplace. It
              differs from “old” liberalism, which argued for tearing down
              tariff barriers and other “hindrances to trade.” In neoliberalism,
              commodification extends into realms that previously resisted it
              such as the human parts market and whole new areas of property
              such as the DNA of a species. Neoliberal economic policies
              generally include the push for privatization of public services,
              lower wages for the majority of workers, and loosening
              restrictions on businesses. See <b>capitalism</b>.

              governments to avoid the bond-financing trap. Bank dividends are
