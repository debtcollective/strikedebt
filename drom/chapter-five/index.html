          Housing Debt: How the American Dream Became a Bait-and-Switch
          Nightmare
        </h1>
        <!--<article  id="post-">-->

        <article class="content">
          <p>
            Many people struggle to find sympathy for those who have borrowed
            beyond their means to pay for something we all must provide for
            ourselves: housing. From the perspective of those who rent, have
            resisted taking on debt, or were fortunate enough to purchase and
            hold onto a home, it can be difficult to empathize with what appear
            to be bad choices. But when morality and debt intersect, appearances
            are often extremely misleading. The reality is that a great deal of
            what lenders, investors, and government agencies told the public
            about the housing market was never true. Decades of false promises,
            irresponsible practices, and collusion between banks and the
            government created a system in which lenders exploited the hopes and
            ambitions of people in the name of endless profit.
          </p>
          <p>
            This chapter will explain how this culture emerged, how it exploits
            the most vulnerable among us, and what we can do about it.
          </p>
          <h2 class="submenu">The Story of the American Homeowner</h2>
          <p>
            You can’t escape the need for shelter. But in the United States,
            this basic need is entangled with a pervasive and often fervent
            belief in the American Dream—that anyone who works hard enough can
            achieve some version of comfortable “middle-class” status. For many
            of us, this status is most visibly realized by the purchase of a
            home. Given the prevalence of this sentiment, it can be easy to
            imagine that the relationship between homeownership and the
            “American Dream” existed from the beginning of time. But this
            central feature of our collective American identity was largely
            created in the 1930s when, in response to the Great Depression, the
            U.S. government began a partnership with private lenders. In order
            to stabilize the existing housing market, they began to construct an
            idea of homeownership as a fail-proof investment.
          </p>
          <h3>A new deal and the mortgage industry we know today</h3>
          <p>
            Before the 1930s, the majority of people in the United States
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMUSCB" target="_blank"
              >did not own</a
            >
            their homes. At that time, the ability to buy a house required that
            you either pay cash, or that you knew someone who would lend you the
            money. The lender could be a bank, but only if you had a good
            relationship with your local banker. Even then, they would only
            allow you to borrow 50% of the property value, and you had to pay it
            off in three to five years.
          </p>
          <p>
            In spite of the relatively low ownership rates and direct limits on
            mortgage access, a housing debt crisis similar to the one in 2008
            emerged. Property values plummeted and mortgages destabilized.
            Lenders refused to renegotiate and borrowers defaulted. At the
            lowest point of the crisis, one in every ten homes was in
            foreclosure. In the 1930s, most banks had no government support or
            backing to sustain them during a crisis. Without money coming in,
            they were unable to lend, which resulted in freezing credit and
            dragged the country further into depression. In order to stabilize
            the market and open the flow of credit, the federal government
            intervened and established the entities we have today: the Home
            Owners’ Loan Corporation (1933), the Federal Housing Administration
            (1934), and the Federal National Mortgage Association (1938), later
            known as Fannie Mae. These institutions were created to underwrite
            the lending system, create new terms for borrowers, and unlock
            credit for the banks to continue lending. Essentially, these
            institutions functioned so that the private banks could continue
            making loans and profit from the higher interest, while shifting the
            increased risk to the public. This partnership between the banks and
            government agencies continues today with almost all mortgages on the
            books of FHA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae—in other
            words, they are guaranteed by taxpayers. In 2011, the federal
            government guaranteed more than 95% of all mortgages, making the
            U.S. taxpaying population the largest backer of home loans and
            shielding the profiting industry from resistance or further
            collapse.
          </p>
          <h3>The ownership society as a tool</h3>
          <h4>Against the workers</h4>
          <p>
            Expanding homeownership was a response by government and banks to
            the debt crisis of the Depression—a means of maintaining credit in
            the system and restoring faith in a failing economic order. It is
            quite apparent how the banks benefit in this relationship,
            outsourcing the risk of their own practices to the public via
            government intervention. But what is in it for the government? Why
            go through such lengths to expand an ownership society that was
            clearly struggling to maintain itself?
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Depression, union membership hit record highs, growing
            from 7% in 1930 to 25% in 1940. This development threatened the
            power of industry and employers, and seemingly had the potential for
            continued growth. Public dollars were used to create a
            state-supported market where workers would individually receive
            support for financing their homes. This had the effect of propping
            up the competitive housing market without further strengthening the
            working class as a whole through direct aid. Far from an American
            dream, the resulting system of homeownership has created a mass of
            disenfranchised debtors, beholden to the debt system. As
            homeownership (and mortgage debt) climbed, union membership began
            its
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMWachter" target="_blank"
              >steady decline</a
            >
            in 1945.
          </p>
          <h4>Against veterans</h4>
          <p>
            During the same period of union growth, World War I veterans
            mobilized against the government. In payment for their war service
            (1914–1918), veterans were offered bonus certificates in 1924 that
            would not be redeemable until 1945, a full twenty-seven years after
            the war. As the country moved into the Great Depression, veterans
            were particularly vulnerable to joblessness. With few alternatives,
            forty-three thousand marchers took to the U.S. Capitol building in
            1932 demanding that they receive their payment. Even after their
            camp was cleared, belongings burned and several veterans killed by
            police, resistance continued. To pacify the movement, jobs were
            offered to the veterans within the New Deal. Most of them took the
            jobs before Congress agreed in 1936 to pay the bonuses early.
          </p>
          <p>
            This powerful movement and others like it illustrated the threat
            that organized veterans could pose at the end of each subsequent
            war. In response, complex packages were developed to compensate
            service members for their duty. Just as before, however, the choice
            was made to provide forms of compensation that encouraged entrance
            into competitive markets and the taking on of individual debt to
            avoid further empowering group strength. Mortgage options became a
            feature of individual veteran compensation. Under the GI Bill, the
            Veterans Administration Mortgage Insurance Program was developed as
            part of the deferred compensation package for service in the armed
            forces. Returning veterans of World War II were given very low
            mortgage rates to encourage entrance to the market as individuals,
            and the practice of the thirty-year loan with 95% financing became a
            new norm. With the “success” of these new long-term loans, banks
            began to offer them to the general population with government
            backing. The market expanded enormously, and by the 1970s
            homeownership had grown to 63% of the American public—and mortgage
            debt became an all-too-essential part of the American experience.
          </p>
          <h3>Communities of color and links to the poor</h3>
          <p>
            The link between racial disparities and homeownership began early
            on. In the early 1900s, the homeownership rate for Blacks was at 21%
            while that of Whites was 49.4%—a nearly 30-point ownership gap that
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMBluestone" target="_blank"
              >continues</a
            >
            to this day. Regulations such as the Jim Crow laws purposefully kept
            Blacks from expanding into the housing market and joining the ranks
            of those accumulating wealth for their subsequent generations. The
            New Deal packages referenced earlier were largely reserved for
            working-class Whites, placing them at odds with workers of color and
            further fracturing the working class along racial lines. During the
            Civil Rights era, peaking in 1960, a new kind of consolidated power
            emerged. As communities of color organized and created powerful
            movements, the familiar tool of individual debt was used again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The competitive market was again expanded to contain a surge in
            power. In the 1970s, growing anger about the longstanding practice
            of redlining (lending discrimination that divides communities along
            racial lines) moved the government to pass the Community
            Reinvestment Act (CRA), which required banks to conduct business in
            the entire geographic area in which they operated—the idea being
            that one area could not be more favored (or ignored) than another in
            terms of approved mortgages and lending. Rating systems were
            established to penalize those banks showing evidence of bias. Still,
            as late as 1992, a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
            claimed that people of color were denied mortgages at
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMMunnell" target="_blank"

            >
            than Whites. In response, the industry, backed by the federal
            government, was called on to broaden access to mortgage credit and
            homeownership by reducing its qualifying standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stated goal of President Clinton’s “National Homeownership
            Strategy: Partners in the American Dream” program was to extend
            homeownership to eight million low-income buyers. But the
            government’s perverse response to racial economic inequality
            increased availability of credit and the <i>expansion</i> of
            crushing mortgage debt, rather than the provision of direct
            assistance through extended public or subsidized housing—further
            enlarging the market and incorporating a significant new segment of
            the population into the ownership/debtor relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through these direct government mandates and the promise of
            trillions of dollars in revenue, the door was open for the lending
            industry to develop complex new products, specifically targeted at
            low-income households and communities of color—all of which were
            intentionally confusing, overwhelming, and generally designed to
            fail the borrower. While the burden of public housing was lifted off
            of the government’s shoulders, mortgage debt was coming down like a
            ton of bricks on unsuspecting families. “Get-rich-quick” schemes
            used new financial products to exploit the hopes of millions. A
            litany of how-to books reinforced the blind faith of the market:

            Let’s say you were dubious about the promises being offered. Like
            anyone ready to make a major decision, you did your research. You
            took a trip to Fannie Mae’s mortgage calculator and tried to assess
            the risks. You imagine your worst-case scenario—your property value
            goes down. What would that look like? You would have received an
            error—literally. The mortgage calculator was incapable of
            forecasting a future of zero or negative growth because they assumed
            that property values <i>always</i> rise. The message became, “The
            time to invest is <i>now</i>.” Unfortunately, that is exactly what
            many people did, entangling themselves in unforeseen obligations, a
            lifetime of debt, and a bubble about to burst.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the worst lending practices include adjustable rate
            mortgages (ARM) where after several years the initial interest rate
            adjusts (often substantially higher), placing a lender in a
            situation where the original math that made the loan affordable no
            longer applies, only the interest is paid and the principle debt
            grows endlessly. “Piggyback mortgages” made the down payment for a
            first mortgage possible with the taking out of a second “piggyback”
            mortgage. Stated income loans (a.k.a. “liar” loans) allowed
            borrowers to simply state their income with no verification and
            enter into mortgages beyond their means. Interest-only payments,
            negative amortization, and hybrids of all of the above empowered the
            banks to entangle anyone with a desire for a home, stability, and
            wealth in a debt scheme they previously would have never qualified
            for.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to back these high-risk loans, banks divided the debt into
            pools with mixtures of risk, making it impossible to separate the
            reliable from the dangerous and selling units of these pools in
            secondary markets with completely unwarranted guarantees of
            security. It turned out to be a huge success—for the banks.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet, despite lenders’ consistently reckless and predatory
            behavior, the dominant narrative is so often warped by the
            “morality” of the debt system. Again and again, we are told the
            story of the irresponsible homeowners who borrowed beyond their
            means and must now live with their poor choices. But the risk of a
            loan is supposed to be assessed both by the borrower and the lender.
            After all, if you are asked to lend someone money, determining the
            likelihood that you’ll actually get it back is part of your decision
            process. However, in the current financial system, the government
            has underwritten the majority of the banks’ risks. The government
            has guaranteed that these lenders will always get their money back,
            plus interest. And even if you wanted to hold someone accountable,
            the actual originators of these toxic loans are often obscured by
            complex chains of repackaging, offloading, and reselling—leaving
            millions of borrowers with no direct lender to negotiate with, no
            access to federal aid, and all of the blame.<b> </b>

            With figures as far-reaching as these, housing debt needs to be
            understood as a highly complex issue concerning us all both
            financially and ethically. The common “blame the victim” account of
            the subprime mortgage crisis ignores the fact that the industry
            developed complex financial instruments to expand the market through
            unsound and, in an overwhelming number of cases, fraudulent means,
            ultimately causing the system to collapse. Many of these “mortgage
            innovations” or “relaxed lending practices” were in fact trapdoor
            schemes to extract wealth from borrowers with false promises and
            exploited desires.

            Preventing Foreclosure on Your (and Your Neighbor&#8217;s) Home
          </h2>
          <p>
            Let&#8217;s say you’re having trouble making your mortgage payments,
            or you’ve already gone into foreclosure but you want to stay in your
            home. What can you do? You have several options, ranging from
            individual to collective, low-risk to high-risk, legal to
            not-so-legal.
          </p>
          <h3>Individual strategies</h3>
          <p>
            1. <i>Explore federal mortgage modification programs.</i> You may
            qualify for government relief under a range of programs established
            in the wake of the housing market collapse, most of which are
            administered through the Treasury Department and the Department of
            Housing and Urban Development (HUD). These include the Making Home
            Affordable Program (MHA), the Home Affordable Modification Program
            (HAMP), and the Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA) (for
            significantly underwater mortgages). If your mortgage is insured by
            the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), there are additional loss
            mitigation programs available. Each program has complicated
            eligibility requirements, which you can learn about on the

              target="_blank"
              >HUD website</a
            >. Then, ask your lenders and loan servicers about your options. If
            you run into difficulties, the HUD website has a list of
            organizations that can contact lenders and servicers on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. <i>Negotiate with your lenders, ideally with some help.</i> In
            seeking professional help, generally watch out for frauds and scams
            (for example, if you’re asked for a lump-sum fee up front). Anyone
            looking to take your mortgage payment and give it to the bank is
            untrustworthy; you’ll want to pay the bank directly. Anyone who
            promises you a silver bullet is probably lying.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>Consult a housing counselor.</i> Organizations like the
              Neighborhood Association Corporation of America (NACA) can point
              you to an accredited housing counselor experienced in negotiating
              with banks. Note that some housing counselors have a vested
              interest in building up their businesses and may be funded by
              banks; some are straight-up frauds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Consult a lawyer.</i> If you cannot afford a lawyer, seek out
              local legal aid organizations, bar associations, or
              community-based organizations (e.g., housing justice
              organizations) for discounted or free legal services.

            <h3><b>A Note on MERS</b></h3>
            <p>
              Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS) is a national
              electronic registration and tracking system for mortgage loans.
              MERS was conceived in the early 1990s by lenders and other
              entities including Bank of America, Countrywide, Fannie Mae, and
              Freddie Mac. Its stated purpose was to save mortgage purchasers
              money.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the past, it was your lender that was on the deed as the
              beneficiary until you paid the loan in full. Your deed and loan
              note were recorded with the local County Recorder’s office. The
              recording of the deed and the note created a public record for the
              transaction. Any ownership change had to be recorded to create a
              clear “chain of title”—a record of ownership that protects the
              owner from false claims to ownership.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the banks decided they could make money by securitizing loans
              privately, they needed a way to manage the paperwork that involved
              selling of notes and deeds repeatedly. If they actually filed with
              the County Recorder each time, it would cost them time and money.
              So they figured out a way around it by cutting corners. Instead of
              your lender’s name on the deed, you’ll find MERS named instead.
              The problem with this is that MERS is really not the owner of your
              loan. How can MERS claim titles to loans they merely track, but do
              not own? If your foreclosure was “robo-signed” by MERS, you may be
              able to fight back on this basis. Discuss this with a lawyer.
            </p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            3.<i> Walk away.</i> Walking away from—that is, strategically
            defaulting on—your mortgage is always an option. The personal
            finance world went ballistic when Suze Orman advised homeowners who
            are more than 20% underwater to walk away. But if you’re that far in
            the hole, cutting your losses may be your best option. Entire
            communities are finding themselves in a vicious cycle of
            foreclosures driving down property values, which in turn reduces
            property taxes and therefore municipal income. Municipal
            indebtedness grows and public services suffer, further driving down
            property values. This death spiral is often impossible to escape. By
            strategically defaulting, you remove yourself from the poisonous
            cycle of individual and collective indebtedness and depreciation.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can decide to walk away immediately, or after taking some
            intermediate steps to explore the full range of options. These steps
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ask your lender to modify the loan by reducing the principal to
              the actual current value of the property.
            </li>
            <li>
              If they say no—which is likely—then ask for a short sale. A short
              sale is a sale for less than the amount owed for a property, and
              the bank takes the loss. Most often banks will say no to this,
              too.
            </li>
            <li>
              As a last step, ask for a deed in lieu of foreclosure. This will
              allow you to transfer the property deed to the bank without going
              through formal foreclosure proceedings. The advantage for you is
              that it allows you to walk away immediately and with no attachment
              to the property. The advantage to the bank is that they may save
              money and lower the risk of borrower vandalism of the property.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Of course, this exit doesn’t come for free. Before you walk away, be
            aware of the consequences of foreclosure. Aside from the loss of
            your home, your credit report and credit score will take a big hit.
            You can expect your score to drop by 85 to 160 points. The
            foreclosure stays on your report for seven years and will impact
            your credit for that period, although it is impossible to know how
            much the impact will dissipate over time since credit reporting
            agencies do not disclose their algorithms. But without a doubt, it
            will be difficult to get another loan for quite some time. One thing
            you should certainly do is dispute the foreclosure with the credit
            reporting agency, forcing them to validate your credit report. CRA
            records are often inaccurate, so dispute them until they show you
            your signature on the loan documents (<i

            You might also consider walking away from your mortgage in strategic
            alliance with other homeowners facing foreclosure—in other words,
            participating in a mortgage strike. If done correctly, a mortgage
            strike could drastically increase your community’s leverage against
            the banks. It is essential that you consult an attorney in this case
            because unlike tenants in a rent strike, homeowners in a mortgage
            strike have no support in the relevant laws.

            4. <i>Rent instead of owning.</i> Although rent is not considered
            consumer debt, owing rent is certainly a form of indebtedness. This
            becomes obvious if you do not pay your rent. Your landlord will
            eventually evict you and you will owe “back rent.” The similarity
            between owing a bank money for shelter and owing a landlord money
            for shelter becomes clear when the bank threatens to take away your
            home. Just as a bank keeps a down payment to cover a potential
            default, a landlord typically requires the tenant to provide a
            security deposit to be deposited in an interest-bearing escrow
            account to guarantee rent.

            A recent Pew study showed that

            >
            on buying and are less attached to the dream of homeownership. The
            younger generation has seen its families suffer from underwater
            properties and fears the downside of ownership more than it desires
            the upside.

            Be warned, however, that renting will not necessarily save you from
            the overall effects of housing debt. Since the foreclosure crisis,
            rents have overwhelmingly increased and in 2011, rental vacancies
            hit a ten-year low. Millions of foreclosed families have no choice
            but to rent, and since it takes seven years for a foreclosure to
            disappear from your credit report, many families are in it for the
            long haul. Of course, wages have not kept pace with rent increases
            and rent is eating up a growing portion of peoples’ incomes. This
            outcome is also felt very unevenly. For example over 25% of Black
            and Latino/a families spend more than half their income on housing
            compared to 15% of White families.

            Unfortunately, no one has been immune to the fraudulent practices
            that led to this mess. Unsustainable housing debt impacts us all.

          <h3>Collective strategies: We are forty million strong</h3>
          <p>
            What does all this add up to? U.S. homeowners have been victims of a
            bank scheme to profit by creating a bubble that could only blow up
            in individual homeowners’ faces. Since we are all affected by the
            housing crisis, the potential for collective action is enormous. For
            systemic change that benefits us all, we need to build power through
            acting together.

            There are an estimated forty million residents of underwater homes
            today, greater than the entire population of California. There’s
            $1.15 trillion in just the underwater portion of mortgages, and $4.8
            trillion in total estimated property
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMHumphries" target="_blank"
              >value of underwater homes</a
            >. Given these numbers, it’s easy to see the potential for
            homeowners to unite under the threat of strategic default. In 2008,
            the federal government passed the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief
            Program (TARP) to bail out banks. TARP specifically called for the
            government to encourage banks to modify loans to prevent
            foreclosures. However, very little money has actually been used to
            bail out homeowners and the banks have done little to change their
            lending practices to help people to avoid losing their homes. In
            fact, the review of loans in foreclosure by banks and their
            consultants was botched so badly that they reached a $3.6 billion
            settlement with regulators, providing cash relief to homeowners who
            entered foreclosure in 2009 or 2010. These homeowners suffered
            illegal foreclosures, including foreclosures despite never having
            missed a mortgage payment. More than half a million homeowners were
            deprived of a loan modification or other

            huge mess that speculators caused.

          <h4>Eviction/auction blockades</h4>
          <p>
            Activists have long used their bodies to blockade evictions of
            foreclosed homeowners and auctions of foreclosed homes. Blockades
            give you more leverage to negotiate a better deal with the bank
            because banks hate public pressure, especially around specific
            homeowners. Banks are softer targets than you might expect because
            so many cases are rife with legal irregularities and outright fraud;
            it’s not uncommon for customers to be mislead, crucial paperwork
            lost, and documents robo-signed. With a little help from your
            friends, you can use this against the banks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blockades raise the cost of foreclosing for the bank, which is
            helpful on both individual and collective levels. In Minneapolis,
            for example, thanks to the work of sixty activists from the
            grassroots group Occupy Homes MN, it took police four attempts and
            thirty-nine arrests to evict one family in the spring of 2012. The
            whole effort cost the city $40,000 (the city had to attack the front
            door with a battering ram), a fact that Occupy Homes MN
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMBradbury" target="_blank"
              >publicized</a
            >
            to shame elected officials for the misuse of public resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eviction and auction blockades can also serve as part of larger
            anti-eviction and anti-foreclosure campaigns that call on the
            legislature to put stronger legal protections in place for
            homeowners and moratoriums on evictions and foreclosures. Such
            reforms are a source of relief for many.

              blockades?</i
            >
            When a home is underwater, the lender has already lost its initial
            investment because it will have to resell the house at today&#8217;s
            depressed fair market value. Who benefits from that resale to the
            market? Often they are “vulture fund” investors who have a lot of
            cash to shop for deals in distressed neighborhoods, only to gentrify
            those neighborhoods or quickly “flip” their investments in order to
            make a profit. They benefit from foreclosures at the expense of
            family, community and—if the mortgage is insured by Fannie Mae or
            Freddie Mac—taxpayers (who must repay the bank the amount of the
            original mortgage).
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>What demands should blockaders make?</i> The most immediate
            demand is to halt or reverse foreclosure, or at least eviction in
            the wake of foreclosure. Our first goal is to stop a human being or
            family from becoming homeless. The next is a “principal reduction”—a
            new loan based on the house’s current value. The benefits of
            principal reductions would ripple out far beyond any particular
            homeowner: Fannie and Freddie could save taxpayers billions by
            adopting principal reduction because
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMFHFA" target="_blank"
              >odds are better</a
            >
            the homeowner will be able to keep making payments and avoid default
            (or re-default).
          </p>
          <p>
            Those in charge argue that principal reductions—achieved by selling
            homes back to foreclosed homeowners—would create a “moral hazard,”
            encouraging others to default on their mortgage. The term “moral
            hazard” is used to describe a situation where a person (or a
            corporation or other unit) takes undue risks because they know that
            someone else will bear the consequences of their risky action. The
            important thing to recognize is that corporations do this all the
            time—for example, corporations pollute with impunity because they do
            not bear the costs of such pollution themselves. In the housing
            market, banks extended risky, speculative mortgage loans to
            homeowners, knowing that if things were to go south, homeowners
            would suffer the consequences, not the banks. “Moral hazard” has
            nothing to do with morality and everything to do with particular
            distributions of power and risk. The question is, what types of
            “moral hazard” are we willing to tolerate?
          </p>
          <h4>Mortgage strikes</h4>
          <p>
            Rent strikes are a time-honored tactic for tenants to demand action
            from a delinquent landlord. Despite the lengthy history of rent
            strikes to gain repairs and other concessions, there is little
            history of mortgage strikes. There are many reasons property owners
            are unwilling to strike—attachment to homeownership, guilt about
            failing to pay debts, fear of bad credit, and hope that the market
            will improve. But as more and more victims of the housing market
            understand the complicated details of the game our government played
            with the banks at our expense, the potential for collective action
            grows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rent strikes work (although the risk of eviction is real) because
            under the lease and the landlord-tenant law regime, the landlord
            must perform its duties (such as keeping the premises habitable) for
            the tenant&#8217;s duty to pay rent to kick in. How are mortgage
            strikes different from rent strikes? Unfortunately, the law does not
            protect homeowner-borrowers as much as it does tenants. This is a
            product of our society&#8217;s pro-creditor bias, as well as the
            lack of a powerful mortgage debtors’ movement. We mustn’t forget
            that the legal protections for tenants making rent strikes possible
            did not always exist—they were obtained through collective action
            throughout the 1960s and ’70s. (In the DC Circuit case,
            <i>Javins v. First National Realty Corp.</i>,<i> </i>the court
            determined that if the premises become uninhabitable, the tenant is
            freed from their obligation to pay rent. The tenant&#8217;s duty to
            pay rent was traditionally regarded as independent of whether the
            landlord fulfilled their duties.)
          </p>
          <p>
            People in the U.S. are beginning to come together to organize
            mortgage strikes. A community-based organization called Empowering
            and Strengthening Ohio&#8217;s People (ESOP) has modeled its
            mortgage strike on rent strikes under Ohio law, which uses a
            court-supervised process. In a rent strike, tenants pay their
            monthly rent to the local court clerk, who holds the payments in
            escrow until the tenants’ complaints are resolved. A mortgage strike
            would follow a similar structure, although it is not specifically
            authorized by Ohio law (making it highly risky). Participating
            homeowners would send money orders covering their regular principal
            and interest payments to a local attorney to hold in escrow until
            the homeowners explicitly release the payments. The attorney’s role
            is to provide an escrow service so that the mortgage servicers and
            lenders are assured of payment after the strike. By collectively
            withholding mortgage payments through this escrow mechanism,
            underwater homeowners can increase their negotiating leverage
            vis-à-vis their shared lenders and servicers.
          </p>
          <p>
            City Life/Vida Urbana (CLVU), a community-based organization in
            Boston has been actively organizing mortgage debtors’ unions, or
            “Bank Tenant Associations”—a product of three decades of grassroots
            organizing. The model is being replicated across the country (and,
            for better or worse, is funded by national and international
            foundations). Bank Tenant Associations get the message out to the
            community, build solidarity, provide access to lawyers, organize
            creative actions that apply public pressure and attract media
            attention, and build leadership in the bank tenants themselves. CLVU
            has established Bank Tenant Associations with thousands of bank
            tenants who have stopped evictions, passed new laws, put pressure on
            the bank to sell back homes at half or less of the original loan
            value, and radically changed both lender and court culture. To give
            just one example, CLVU is initiating a pilot project in two
            organized neighborhoods to convert occupied foreclosed buildings
            into permanently affordable, resident-controlled homes. These
            grassroots movements can only lead to a broader, national demand for
            principal reduction and prioritizing affordable housing going
            forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            CLVU has published a
            <a href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMCLVU2" target="_blank"
              >Bank Tenant Association Organizing Manual</a
            >
            that details the myriad steps and dynamics of organizing a mortgage
            debtor&#8217;s union. Among other things, the manual includes
            creative ways to partner with community (not-for-profit) banks,
            which can buy underwater properties and sell them back to homeowners
            at their real value (a better result than in most loan modification
            efforts by for-profit banks), and much more.

            Home Is Where the Heart Is: Creating a Housing Commons

          <p>
            Blockades and mortgage strikes are powerful tactics to prevent
            foreclosures right now, but let&#8217;s not lose sight of our
            ultimate vision: a world where housing is a human right and an asset
            of the commons. To that end, we can continue historic commoning
            practices such as taking over and rehabilitating vacant homes and
            maintaining community land trusts (which allow the community to own
            land based on principles of democracy, affordability, and
            sustainability). We have seen how the irresponsible forces of the
            market have wrecked homes and lives. We must build our own resilient
            homes going forward, and that is most likely to succeed if we do it
            together.
