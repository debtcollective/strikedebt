            Workers in the United States continue to be among the most
            productive in the world, yet median wages have barely increased over
            the past four decades. We’ve been working longer and harder, trying
            to keep up with the rising costs of living—housing, health care,
            education—yet we haven’t actually managed to keep up without
            plastic. In the early 1980s, U.S. household debt as a share of
            income was around 60%. By the time of the 2008 financial crisis,
            that share had grown to exceed 100%, and today

              target="_blank"
              >it’s hovering around 112%</a
            >. So despite the fact that productivity has gone up, we have relied
            more and more on credit as a means of subsistence. This, in turn,
            intricately weaves people into the complex debt system at the heart
            of modern capitalism. This process essentially ensures that we will
            be dependent on Wall Street to provide us with a “lifeline” of
            credit. These “lifelines” of credit don’t really solve our problems,
            though. Instead, they only make things worse in the long run.

            The credit card industry is notorious for its lack of transparency,
            which makes credit cards some of the most hazardous and confusing
            financial tools out there. At their core, they embody the deceptive
            and bottom line–driven processes that are the engine of mafia
            capitalism. Many credit cards feature a fluctuating interest rate
            and a multiplicity of complicated and hidden fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like credit card debt, car debt—money borrowed to purchase an
            automobile—is a form of consumer debt that enmeshes individuals,
            perhaps unwittingly, in the debt system. For many who live outside
            the public transportation infrastructure of a major city, owning a
            car is a necessity, not a luxury. (How else will they get to their
            job so they can earn money to pay off their auto loan?) But
            maintaining a car—buying gas, paying for repairs, paying for parking
            tickets—is an expensive undertaking. Sometimes, these payments are
            made with a credit card, thus compounding the consumer’s debt and
            further entangling them into our predatory financial system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today in the United States, credit cards and automobiles are
            inescapable parts of daily life for many people. Throughout this
            chapter, we analyze the different ways the credit card and auto loan
            industries profit off people through duplicitous means. In doing so,
            we explain the history of the credit card industry, in particular
            what economic and political conditions allowed for the rise and
            proliferation of credit, and how credit has affected different
            communities. For both forms of consumer debt, we introduce
            strategies for practical alternatives, while hoping to open up
            avenues that allow for other, more creative individual and
            collective resistance strategies. We also explore the different ways
            you—the worker and consumer—can fight back to regain some of your
            economic independence.

            the defining features of life in the United States—our plastic

          <h3>History in reverse</h3>
          <p>
            When credit cards were first introduced in the 1960s, the credit
            card industry would make its money on interest rates, but this never
            amounted to much. Universal credit cards such as Visa and MasterCard
            were offered then as loyalty rewards only to banks’ “best” customers
            who paid off their monthly balances—that is, affluent White men. The
            appeal of the cards was convenience and prestige, not a need for
            credit. Banks lost money on the product, but the idea was to build
            loyalty in order to do even bigger business down the road. The banks
            got something in return as well: the wealthiest, most powerful men
            served as walking advertisements for the cards every time they used
            one. In contrast, today, cardholders who never carry balances on
            their cards are known inside the industry as “deadbeats,” or
            “money-losers.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A series of legal changes—effectively eliminating usury laws by
            allowing all lenders to register in South Dakota, where no such laws
            existed—along with the growth of computer networks that could trace
            credit ratings, led to an explosion of credit card use in the 1980s.
            Interest rate deregulation helped transform credit cards from banks’
            loss leaders into profit engines. As more people acquired credit
            cards throughout the ’80s and ’90s, the wealthiest households’
            credit cards were subsidized by the least wealthiest households.
            This is sometimes called “risk pooling,” although typically pooling
            involves those with more subsidizing those with less; here it’s the
            reverse. Through the use of so-called “risk-based pricing,” credit
            card companies actually charge financially distressed households
            more to use their cards. Card companies claim that interest rate
            charges are based on “risk,” but there is abundant evidence that the
            risk ratings are largely determined by where you live, a practice
            known as “redlining.” Redlining was historically used to deny
            residents and businesses access to credit in predominantly Black
            neighborhoods—without using explicitly racial/ethnic criteria.
            However, now high-risk ratings are used to charge more for credit—a
            practice often referred to as “reverse redlining”—and this condition
            sets up a self-fulfilling prophecy. Being designated financially
            “risky” actually further exposes one to unfair and abusive financial
            practices. According to Robert D. Manning, founder of the
            Responsible Debt Relief Institute and author of
            <i>Credit Card Nation</i>, “[a] carefully guarded secret of the
            industry is that about a quarter of cardholders have accounted for
            almost two-thirds of interest and penalty-fee revenues. Nearly

            As mentioned above, U.S. household debt as a share of income has
            risen from 60% to over 100% in the past thirty years. So, despite
            all our exertions as workers over this period, the majority of us
            have only gone deeper into debt. The prime reason is clear: we’re in
            debt because we’re not paid enough in the first place. In the United
            States, there’s minimal or non-existent social protection available
            to support us as we struggle to provide for our own basic needs and
            those of our dependents. Consolidated corporate greed, with its
            never-ending appetite for profit above all, continues to trump our
            basic rights. In a financial system characterized by a lack of
            transparency, credit cards are a complicated and risky product upon
            which too many of us depend. Additionally, credit cards feature a
            number of complicated, disguised fees; according to Professor Adam
            Levitin of Georgetown University Law Center, these “gotcha” fees
            cost families in the United States

            Although total national credit card debt is small in comparison with
            mortgage debt, effective APRs (annual percentage rates) on credit
            cards are at least five times as high as mortgage loans. The moment
            consumers get into trouble, card companies pounce, imposing
            penalties, even retroactively. These practices are unfair and
            abusive. In an attempt to address them, in 2009 Congress passed the

            Today, there are more than five thousand credit cards issuers; a

            After the crash of 2008, families scrambled to get out of debt. Some
            were helped by the useful, if limited, regulatory reforms prescribed
            by the CARD Act.

            as regulations take effect and cardholders wise up to the industry’s
            old tricks. The problem is that, meanwhile, card companies have been
            devising new tricks, household expenses have risen, and incomes have
            either remained stagnant or have fallen. The total amount of credit
            card debt remains staggeringly high, and card issuers are still free
            to charge whatever rates of interest they like. (Only nonprofit
            credit unions are required by Congress to abide by an interest-rate
            ceiling of 15%.)
          </p>
          <p>
            In the nine months between the passage and implementation of the
            CARD Act, credit card issuers did their best to hike interest rates,
            reduce lines of credit, increase fees, and water down rewards
            programs. For the millions with poor credit scores and borrowing
            costs that are through the roof, it may already be too late. Now, as
            credit scores are widely used as a screening tool for job
            applicants, workers face even greater challenges in finding
            employment, much less entering the increasingly mythological U.S.
            middle class.

          <h3>The tricks of the trade<i></i></h3>
          <p>
            From risk-rating to pricing to credit limit determination, credit
            industry policies are extremely opaque and seem designed to keep
            cardholders in the dark. Analysts at Credit Karma, however, were
            able to study a sample of over two hundred thousand credit cards;
            the relationship between credit scores, income, and credit limits
            indicated that higher credit scores get you higher credit limits,
            regardless of income. Low credit scores, no matter your income,

          </p>
          <p>
            A history of compliance with minimum payments is more important to
            issuers than current ability to repay. Credit card companies don’t
            mind late payments if you maintain a balance, as long as you pay
            your monthly minimum. Remember us “deadbeats”? Since almost all of
            the issuers’ profits come from late fees and interest rate
            penalties, they depend on our slip-ups. This is why monthly
            statements are intentionally designed to be confusing. If they
            change the design of your statement—say, by moving a box to the
            left, or making the print a little smaller—in such a way as to cause
            even one cardholder out of a thousand to misunderstand and miss a
            payment, that’s millions of dollars in additional profit for the
            credit card company. In the past, companies would trip up consumers
            by making the due date fall on a Sunday or a holiday, creating more
            “deadbeats” from which to profit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CARD Act outlawed several of the most predominant predatory
            lending practices. For instance, in the past, companies needed to
            provide only fifteen days notice before raising rates or making
            other changes to your contract, leaving little time to negotiate.
            Now, companies are required to notify customers

            be sure to read everything your credit card company sends. Since the
            1990s, credit card pricing has been a game of “<a

            >,” according to Levitin. “Pricing has been shifted away from the
            upfront, attention-grabbing price points, like annual fees and base
            interest rates, and shifted to back-end fees that consumers are
            likely to ignore or underestimate.” If we are unable to gauge the
            true cost of financial products, how can we be expected to use them
            responsibly?

            For a credit card company, the perfect customer is one who charges
            up a large amount of debt impulsively, sits on it for a year or two
            so as to build up maximum high-rate interest charges, finally feels
            guilty, and pays it all back without asking any questions. That’s
            why companies used to besiege high school and college students with
            free card offers: they calculated that students were likely to spend
            impulsively, attempt to avoid the problem, and eventually call their
            parents to foot the bill. The CARD Act restricts extensions of
            credit to those under twenty-one unless they have a cosigner or a
            proven means of income. Credit card companies are

            The overwhelming bulk of credit card debt isn’t driven by impulse
            spending at all, but by the predicaments of people trying to make
            ends meet. Even when jobless or unemployed, we remain consumers; our
            basic needs still include education, groceries, housing, doctor’s
            visits, medicine, and transportation. One survey found that

            >
            report having to live, to some degree, off of their credit cards
            until they find new jobs. According to another survey, medical bills
            are a leading contributor to credit card debt, affecting nearly half
            of low- to middle-income households; the average amount of medical
            debt on credit cards is

          <h3>What can we do?</h3>
          <p>
            Obviously, no one wants to sit on a huge pile of “revolving” credit
            card debt accruing interest at usurious rates every month.
            Unfortunately, credit cards are the double-edged sword of the credit
            score world. If we have cards with high balances, our scores go
            down. If we have <i>no </i>credit card, our scores go down. Having
            low credit scores can keep us from getting the things we need, like
            an affordable mortgage, apartment, or job. If we don’t buy on
            credit, then banks will see us as “risky,” and will not loan. On the
            other hand, if we have a credit card but spend too much, then we
            will also be denied a loan.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you can’t avoid having the cards, you can sidestep the traps by
            understanding the fine print.

            Whether you’re drowning in credit card debt or simply have too many
            cards, the most appropriate tactics for fighting back against the
            credit card trap will depend on your individual needs and
            circumstances. Below we suggest a few options, including legal
            action, bankruptcy, or simply refusing to pay.
          </p>
          <h4>Going to court<i></i></h4>
          <p>
            You may have seen those lawyers who appear on late-night TV
            promising that they can get us out of debt. Surprisingly, some of
            them actually can! This is how the honest ones do it.
          </p>
          <p>
            What most people don’t realize is that, legally, there’s nothing
            special about owing money. A debt is just a promise and,
            contractually, no promise is more or less sacrosanct than any other.
            If one signs with a credit card company, both the signer and the
            company are agreeing to abide by a contract that is equally binding.
            The fine print applies to both sides, so if American Express has
            failed to fulfill any of its contractual obligations—for instance,
            its obligation to alert us promptly of a change of policy—that’s
            just as much a violation of contract as our failure to pay the
            agreed-upon sum. Knowing how this industry works, any skilled lawyer
            with a copy of the contract and access to all relevant
            correspondence is likely to discover half a dozen ways the company
            has violated its contractual obligations. In the eyes of the law,
            both parties are guilty, so we may have the power to renegotiate the
            terms of the relationship. This usually means that the judge can
            knock off half or even three-quarters of the total sum owed.

            The credit card industry is riddled with fraud on a scale that is
            only now beginning to be revealed. “The same problems that plagued
            the foreclosure process—and prompted a multibillion-dollar
            settlement with big banks—are now emerging in the debt collection
            practices of credit card companies,” the
            <i>New York Times</i> reported in 2012. “As they work through a glut
            of bad loans, companies like American Express, Citigroup and
            Discover Financial are going to court to recoup their money. But
            many of the lawsuits rely on erroneous robo-signed [i.e.,
            automatically computer generated] documents, incomplete records, and
            generic testimony from witnesses, according to judges who oversee
            the cases.” Lenders are “churning out lawsuits without regard for
            accuracy, and improperly collecting debts from consumers.” One judge

            In some cases, banks have sold credit card receivables known to be

            called CACH, LLC, based in Denver, Colorado. Each month CACH bought

              >$65 million for 1.8 cents on the dollar</a
            >. The cut-rate pricing suggests the accounts’ questionable quality,
            but what is remarkable is that the bank would even try to sell them
            and that it could make money from them. Over the last two years,
            Bank of America has charged off $20 billion in delinquent card debt.
            An undisclosed portion of the delinquent debt gets passed along to
            collectors. Once sold, rights to such accounts are often resold
            within the industry multiple times over several years. Other banks
            have also admitted that their debt sale contracts may be riddled
            with inaccuracies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lesson is, always keep copies of everything. Always keep open
            the option of legal action (small claims or otherwise), and make
            sure the credit card companies know that you’re doing so.
          </p>
          <h4>What happens if you just don’t pay?<i></i></h4>
          <p>
            After ninety days of non-payment, your account goes into default and
            the credit card company has the option of sending it off to a debt
            collection agency. They don’t really like this option, because they
            will be taking a huge loss. Debt collection agencies make their
            money by buying up your debt at pennies on the dollar, often through
            brokers, and then trying to collect the whole thing, plus fees for
            the cost of collection. The original lender takes a loss. No doubt
            they can get some of it back through tax accounting and no doubt
            they figure a certain percentage of that loss into their business
            model, but ultimately they would rather this didn’t happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obviously this is a bad thing for us as well; it means we will be
            hounded by a collection agency and our credit scores will take a
            major hit. If we want to borrow in the future, it might not be
            possible. If we <i>are</i> able to borrow, we will be charged much
            higher interest rates. If that isn’t a concern, then go ahead,
            default: it’s free money! But for most of us, it is a problem, so we
            must turn to other measures.
          </p>
          <h4>Negotiating with the credit card company<i></i></h4>
          <p>
            Since credit card companies don’t want us to default, we can often
            negotiate. They may offer a substantial reduction on what we owe
            them if they think defaulting is our only other option. Remember:
            even if we offer them ten cents on the dollar, that’s more than they
            would be getting if they sold it to a collection agency. On the
            other hand, they may not want to set a precedent—they know that if
            everyone just held out and negotiated a 90% reduction, their
            business would be ruined. So they are being pulled in two different
            directions. This is important to bear in mind when negotiating. If
            you’re seriously thinking about negotiating, see

          <h4>Default versus bankruptcy</h4>
          <p>
            When you fail to make payments on your credit card, it falls into
            default. When this happens, your credit card company usually
            “closes” the card, meaning that no further charges will be allowed
            on the account. But that doesn’t mean that the balance goes away—far
            from it. Interest and late fees will continue to accrue until you
            pay the balance. If you don’t, the credit card company will most
            likely hire a collection agency to hound you for the money.
          </p>
          <p>
            Declaring bankruptcy is an alternative to going into default. When
            you declare bankruptcy, credit card debts may be wiped out or
            lessened. However, it is a complex process that can backfire in many
            cases. In addition, bankruptcy will affect your credit rating for
            the next seven to ten years. If you are thinking of declaring
            bankruptcy, refer to
            <a

            of this manual. The statute of limitations on defaults—the amount of
            time creditors or collectors have after you default to try to get it
            back legally—differs from state to state, from as little as three
            years to as many as ten. But after it’s over, you’re entirely off
            the hook and it’s easy to wipe the default off your record. Which
            option to choose will vary according to your individual
            circumstances. Try to get all information about the different
            possibilities in your state of residence before you decide.

            What about those people who use one credit card to pay interest on
            another?<i></i>
          </h4>
          <p>
            There definitely are people who have figured out the ropes―the way
            that one’s credit score interacts with multiple credit card
            accounts, and so forth―so well that they can live off their credit
            cards for years before defaulting. It can be done. The major proviso
            is that making a living this way is not all that much easier than
            making a living in a more conventional way, and it has the
            disadvantage of being extremely risky and time-consuming. If you,
            along with figuring out all the possible legal ramifications, deem
            this acceptable, then go ahead. Consider that for some, going “off
            the financial grid” is an easier way to live (<i

          <h3>Resisting the credit card industry</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike student debt, a movement against credit card debt has yet to
            form. Launching such a movement is one of the aims of this manual
            and of Strike Debt. In the meantime, here are some examples of
            individual resistance actions that some people have taken. They tend
            toward the playful and absurd. As always, beware of the risks before
            you engage in such behavior.

            Dimitry Agarkov, a forty-two-year-old from Russia, managed to
            mischievously turn the tables on the credit card industry, and has
            inspired others to do the same. Agarkov, discontented with
            unsolicited credit card offers from his country’s leading online
            bank, Tinkoff Credit Systems, scanned, amended, and returned the
            contracts. In their rush to capitalize on the contracts, the bank
            signed off on them without reading them. Two years later, due to
            overdue payments on a balance of $575 in rubles, Agarkov’s card was
            terminated. Agarkov later decided to

            Until we can organize and mount genuine collective resistance
            against credit card debt, registering your displeasure through
            symbolic gestures might help let off some steam. One such gesture is
            to gather with friends to stuff credit card companies’
            <i>own</i> prepaid envelopes that they’ve sent to you along with
            their offers. Stuff each envelope with wooden shims or roofing
            shingles to increase the postage costs and send them back to the
            company at their own expense. This is an example of an action that
            transforms debtors from passive victims to active rejecters of
            financialization tools. Also, as the proceeds of this action go to
            the U.S. Postal Service, we can help slow down this country’s fast
            track toward mail-delivery privatization.

            a loan to buy a car in order to commute to work, only to discover

            held by families in the country, and as an asset they are a natural
            candidate for creating <i>secured debt</i>. This means that unlike
            credit card agreements, which have no collateral, if you don’t repay
            the auto loan, the car—as the underlying asset securing the loan—can
            be repossessed and sold by the creditor to cover its losses. Given
            how dependent many of us are on cars, repossession can be
            devastating. Costs associated with cars can also add to credit card
            debt, so if you are not well-to-do, sliding further into debt is
            nearly impossible to avoid.

            Framing alternatives: Transportation infrastructure as commons
          </h3>
          <p>
            One of the root causes of the scourge of car debt is the absence of
            affordable and reliable public transit. This lack of reliable
            transportation options tends to fall upon poor households and
            households of color the hardest. The troubles that come with
            insufficient access to safe and clean transportation for work or
            schooling in struggling communities are further compounded by
            advanced age, disability, illness, and whether one has dependents to
            transport. Although many see the purchase of an automobile as a
            ticket to prosperity and happiness, creating more car owners is not
            a solution to our collective transportation woes. Rather, the
            solution is to create infrastructure and practices around
            transportation that make transportation a collective good, rather
            than a private asset that must be financed by debt. Doing so will
            not only hopefully reduce the effects of car debt but also of

            One thing we can do is to demand at the local, state, regional, and
            national levels transportation infrastructure and policies that are
            not centered on private automobiles, such as walking, biking, moped
            and scooter use, and transit such as trains (from local light rail
            to high-speed regional and transcontinental services), buses, and
            trolleys. One such example at the local level is families organizing
