        <!--<article  id="post-">-->

        <article class="content">
          <h2 class="submenu">Who’s the Real Debtor Here?</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout this manual, we’ve been examining the many ways in which
            the wealthy and the powerful use claims of debt to steal from and
            exert control over the vast majority of us. No matter how
            destructive the results, we are constantly told (and tell ourselves)
            that such a system is morally just because of a supposedly simple,
            eternal truth: <i>Money owed must be repaid</i>. This deeply
            entrenched and widely held belief in the black-and-white morality of
            debt is the linchpin that holds the debt system in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            But nothing is ever as simple as it seems. At their core, monetary
            debts are extremely narrow and simplified ways of representing what
            are often very complicated relationships between creditors and
            debtors. If we can zoom out from the simple calculation of money
            owed and look at the broader histories, human relationships, and
            power dynamics that lie behind a debt, it quickly becomes clear that
            there are countless ways to imagine who owes what to whom. Seen in
            this expanded context, a claim that repayment of a debt is morally
            just can begin to seem absurd. (And yet, despite the
            often-questionable moral legitimacy of their claims, the harsh truth
            is that it’s usually the ones with the most powers of
            <a

            at their disposal that get to decide which debts are legitimate in
            the end.)<a title="" href="#_ftn1"><br /> </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowhere is this dynamic better represented than by the sovereign
            debts imposed on the people of the global South, as discussed in the
            <a
              title="Chapter Thirteen. National Debt: The Politics of Scarcity and Control"
              href="/drom/chapter-thirteen/"
              target="_blank"
              >previous chapter</a
            >. For decades, northern banks, the IMF, and the World Bank have
            demanded that residents of much poorer countries be held responsible
            for the repayment of loans taken on in their names, often by
            undemocratic regimes and under outrageous terms that might make a
            Goldman Sachs banker blush. Under the simple logic of debt, the
            failure to repay such loans has been used to justify the imposition
            of harsh, undemocratic “reforms” that have caused immense suffering.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if we pull back and begin to look at the long history of
            domination, exploitation, and destruction imposed on the people of
            debtor nations to the benefit of their so-called creditors, it
            immediately becomes apparent just how questionable the morality of
            these simple calculations is. For instance, how many dollars should
            Great Britain pay African nations for the approximately 2.8 million
            people they abducted into the transatlantic slave trade? What should
            the annual interest rate be on the debt Spain owes, say, Peru, for
            the tons of silver it extracted through forced labor, and what
            should the penalty be for five hundred years of late payment? Though
            such calculations could never account for the true cost of centuries
            of suffering and oppression, when confronted with the simple
            morality that states “all debts must be repaid,” it’s important to
            think for a moment about who is really the debtor, and who is the
            creditor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along those lines, as the effects of human-induced climate change
            have begun to wreak havoc on a global scale, global justice
            movements have formulated a vitally important question in response:
            How do the South’s monetary debts to foreign creditors compare with
            the North’s liabilities for environmental impacts since the dawn of
            industrialization? The resulting concept of climate debt, first
            introduced almost twenty-five years ago, has provoked a powerful
            ongoing dialogue, elucidating stark disparities in how climate
            change is caused and experienced around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            After over two hundred years of humans spewing massive amounts of
            carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the earth’s
            atmosphere, the planet is on the verge of an unprecedented
            ecological catastrophe. We’ve already seen record-breaking droughts,
            superstorms, hurricanes, heat waves, and floods. And that’s just the
            tip of the (quickly melting) iceberg. But, historically, people in
            what have come to be known as “developed nations” are by far the
            <a
              title="“A New Global Economy for a New Generation”"

              >largest emitters of greenhouse gases</a
            >
            and have reaped the lion’s share of the economic benefits when
            compared to those of the global South. And although the whole planet
            is experiencing rising temperatures, the impact is far from equal.
            Both the IMF and the World Bank have acknowledged that the brunt of
            the impact will be borne by some of the poorest populations in the
            world, further immiserating them.<a title="" href="#_ftn2"

          <p>
            To say nothing of the human misery, suffering, and death wrought by
            climate change—past, present, and future—surely even just the simple
            monetary costs to the South of repairing damage, adapting as
            possible, and mitigating future damage must be considered a massive
            debt owed to them by the North. In demanding repayment of this debt,
            movements for climate justice have done much to highlight the
            economic forces that compel the destruction of the environment for
            the benefit of the few at the expense of all—but particularly the
            world’s poorest. To truly understand the nature of the debt that’s
            owed, we’ll need to understand the origins of the climate crisis a
            bit more thoroughly.
          </p>
          <h3>Growth, development, and the origins of climate debt</h3>
          <p>
            The current vast disparities in wealth, power, and standards of
            living between the people of developed nations and those of the
            global South reflect long histories of colonial domination and,
            later, exploitation through the neoliberal global economic order. In
            many ways, this centuries-long dynamic has been intensified, shaped,
            and transformed by industrialized nations’ utter addiction to
            carbon-based fuels.
          </p>
          <p>
            For most of human history, the naturally renewable energy sources
            humans used to sustain ourselves were readily found on the earth’s
            surface: firewood, wind, water, animal power, etc. But, at around
            the turn of the nineteenth century, as the industrial era was
            dawning, new technologies made it possible to mine massive
            quantities of carbon-based fuel in the form of coal. Suddenly,
            people in the industrial centers of northern and central Europe (and
            soon the United States) were able to tap into extraordinarily potent
            stores of energy that had accumulated below the earth over millions
            of years (Mitchell 2011, 15).<a title="" href="#_ftn3"><br /> </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The introduction of such an intense productive power into Europe’s
            mix of industrial capitalist and colonial enterprises created
            enormous amounts of wealth and began a stretch of growth in
            productive output unparalleled in human history. It also had
            profound impacts on the way Western societies developed, continually
            transforming everything from modes of transportation, agriculture,
            and the organization of cities, to legal systems, forms of
            government, and the division of labor (Harvey 2010, 203). Colonies,
            mobilized to provide critical raw materials for Western industry,
            were industrialized at a much slower pace and, over time, the
            disparity in wealth between them and their colonizers increased
            exponentially.
          </p>
          <p>
            In various ways, the large-scale transition of Western economies
            from coal to oil and the emerging global economic order of the
            mid-twentieth century greatly reduced the political power of labor
            and increasingly freed capitalist interests from the control of
            nation states. With capitalist profit-seeking behavior liberated and
            further intensified by uninterrupted flows of carbon in the form of
            oil, it became possible to imagine a global economic system based on
            growth without limits—though that growth was increasingly
            concentrated in the hands of the few, at home and abroad (Mitchell
            2011, 15).

            By the time the era of direct colonialism came to an end in the
            decades following World War II, carbon-rich industrialization had so
            thoroughly transformed the entire “Western way of life” that
            traditional ways of living in far-less industrialized countries of
            the global South stood in stark contrast. Without irony,
            industrialized governments seeking to extend their economic and
            political control pointed to the disparity in wealth between the
            “developed” North and the “undeveloped” South as justification for
            the imposition of unsustainable and paternalistic economic
            development programs through institutions like the IMF (Escobar
            1995, 17). Promising investments and improvements in material
            conditions, “development experts” were deployed across the global
            South to push for the top-down implementation of economic,
            technological, and social changes, dismissing indigenous traditions
            and worldviews that might conflict with their visions of “progress.”
          </p>
          <p>
            But, to many, it’s long been clear that Western-style economic
            development is as unsustainable as the Western way of life itself.
            In 1972, the influential Club of Rome think-tank published a
            groundbreaking and disturbing report titled <i>The</i>
            <i>Limits to Growth, </i>which concluded that the current rates of
            industrial growth could not be sustained ecologically in the
            long-term (Meadows et al. 1972). Subsequent surveys, drawing upon a
            wider range of experts and a more comprehensive network of
            scientific data, amplified the 1972 warning about the ruinous impact
            of unrestrained growth. Thirty years later, the
            <i>Limits to Growth </i>team reprised their study, confirming the
            original predictions of economic and civilizational collapse in the
            course of the twenty-first century (Meadows, Randers, and Meadows
            2004).<a title="" href="#_ftn8"

          <p>
            Despite these and many other grave warnings, at this current stage
            of industrial capitalist development, carbon-enabled growth has
            become so deeply imbricated in the political, economic, and social
            operations of everyday life in developed nations that growth is no
            longer a means to an end, but a necessary end in itself. If
            capitalism is to continue in anything like its current form,
            production and consumption must steadily increase whether or not
            they fulfill a genuine need. Any slowdown in economic growth (a
            recession) and the entire system begins to fall apart. Perversely,
            governments at all levels are tasked first and foremost with
            ensuring growth—a good quality of life for their citizens is a
            distant second at best, and the health of the planet that sustains
            us barely registers (Harvey 2010, 259).

          <h3>The crisis is here</h3>
          <p>
            Whatever one might make of the decision to organize entire societies
            around the need for ever-increasing profits, the fact of the matter
            is that such a choice is no longer an option—at least when it comes
            to profits enabled by carbon-based fuels. For one thing, the earth’s
            supply of carbon-based energy is limited, and we’re starting to bump
            up against that limit. Extracting fossil fuels has become an
            increasingly costly and energy-intensive enterprise, and while we
            may be able to prolong the inevitable with new, environmentally
            destructive technologies like fracking and deep-sea drilling, it
            won’t be long before the costs and energy required to extract carbon
            from the earth outweigh the benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            But more importantly, the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation,
            and other destruction of plant life through capitalist activity has
            lead to a massive buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the
            earth’s atmosphere. Before industrialization, carbon absorbed by
            plants and the oceans more or less balanced emissions from volcanoes
            and other sources. But over the last two centuries of carbon-fueled
            capitalist growth, a dramatic rise in greenhouse gases has begun to
            increase the amount of heat retained on the planet, causing wild
            fluctuations in global temperatures and destabilizing the balance
            that made settled human life possible for the past twelve thousand
            years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientists calculate the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
            in measurements of parts per million (PPM). Historically, carbon
            dioxide was about 275 PPM. NASA scientist James Hansen has
            calculated that the highest level of carbon dioxide and its
            equivalents that the atmosphere can safely contain is
            <a

              >about 350 PPM</a
            >. Currently, we’re at 394 PPM and rising rapidly. The average
            global temperature has already increased by one degree Celsius and
            predictions consistent with current observations suggest that the
            temperature will rise by six to eight degrees Celsius by 2100 unless
            dramatic measures are taken soon. All the ruinous impacts we have
            seen so far are just the beginning. We’re quickly approaching a
            point of no return.
          </p>
          <p>
            The development-inclined World Bank concludes in a recent report
            that even if countries adhere to UN-brokered emissions-reduction
            pledges—and they haven’t been thus far—we’re likely to see a 3.5 to
            4 degree Celsius increase this century. The report warns that such
            an increase will result in unprecedented heat waves, water scarcity,
            food shortages, droughts, increasingly powerful hurricanes,
            inundation of coastal cities, and severe impacts on ecosystems.
            Ominously, it continues, “a 4°C [warmer] world is so different from
            the current one that it comes with

            Some see global crisis on an unprecedented scale unfolding in as
            little as a few years. Guy McPherson, an ecologist who has been
            studying climate change for twenty-five years, estimates that we’ll
            cross the threshold of 400 PPM in the next couple of years. “At that
            time,” he says, “we’ll also see the loss of Arctic ice in the
            summers.” Loss of Arctic ice means solar radiation that would
            otherwise have been reflected back out of the atmosphere will now be
            absorbed by the ocean, causing a significant intensification in
            warming and unleashing a host of unpredictable repercussions for
            global weather patterns. He warns, “The implications are truly

          <h3>Calculating the debt</h3>
          <p>
            The concept of ecological debt was first introduced by Chile’s
            Instituto de Ecología Política in the lead-up to the 1992 Earth
            Summit in Rio de Janeiro—the first major international climate
            summit, involving representatives and heads of state from 172
            governments. Ecological debt was explicitly presented as a framework
            for discussing how much of their sovereign debts countries in the
            South should pay in light of the historical legacy of resource
            exploitation, loss of biodiversity, pollution, and outright
            destruction they’ve suffered at the hands of the North. Many argued
            that the obligation to repay the more recent high-interest loans had
            to be
            <a
              title="“Climate Debt Denial”"

            >
            from the more distant past.<a title="" href="#_ftn13"><br /> </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            But, as with any monetary debt, the full dimensions of ecological
            debt did not readily lend themselves to quantification. (How do you
            calculate the dollar value of a traditional way of living that’s no
            longer possible?) Still, carbon emissions can be reliably measured
            and certainly represent a quantifiable economic benefit to those who
            emit them, alongside a neatly correlating negative impact on the
            climate we all share. As the impacts of global climate change came
            more clearly into view, this portion of the ecological obligation,
            appraised on the basis of atmospheric emissions estimates by nation,
            emerged as the main vehicle for demanding repayment, and
            subsequently came to be known as climate debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            A brief look at the breakdown of carbon emissions by nation over
            time quickly confirms what we already know: the lion’s share of the
            greenhouse gases that are now wreaking ecological havoc were emitted
            to benefit industrial economies, profit-seeking enterprises, and the
            attendant consumer culture rooted in countries of the North. To give
            one quick example of the disparities the data reveals,
            <a
              title="“Rich, Poor and Climate Change”"

          </p>
          <p>
            Though the profits of climate destruction tend to accrue to those
            who’ve caused it, it so happens that the world’s poorest people,
            largely in nations of the global South, experience the destructive
            effects in extreme disproportion. One reason for this disparity is
            geographical: increase in sea levels, desertification, and storms
            all tend to occur with the most intensity nearer to the equator,
            around which many of the world’s poorest nations are arrayed.
            Additionally, many inhabitants of the South live and sustain
            themselves in traditional ways that are often intimately reliant on
            their specific local environments. When those environments change
            dramatically, or are no longer inhabitable, the challenge of
            adapting is far greater than it is for the larger proportion of
            people in industrialized nations whose climate-change-inducing
            consumption and production processes are less specifically local.
          </p>
          <p>
            Poorer nations also simply lack the money needed to mitigate, adapt
            to, or repair the destruction that’s being visited upon them. The
            impact of recovery and cleanup is eating into a significant
            percentage of the GDP of nations that are already struggling to
            maintain a foothold in a global economy stacked against them. In
            2012, record-breaking Typhoon Bopha slammed into the Philippines,
            causing then-unprecedented death and destruction. Describing his
            country’s predicament at the time, a Filipino UN negotiator
            explained, “We have never had a typhoon like Bopha. . . . Each
            destructive typhoon season costs us 2% of our GDP, and the
            reconstruction costs a further 2%, which means we

            The following year, the Philippines were hit again. Typhoon Haiyan,
            the strongest cyclone to make landfall in recorded history, killed
            over six thousand people, displaced millions more, and caused
            billions of dollars of damage. Such events will undoubtedly continue
            with increasing frequency and intensity thanks to the
            greenhouse-gas-induced warming of the ocean. Why should Filipinos,
            who on average emit 0.9 metric tons of carbon annually, pay for the
            destruction wrought by people in nations like the United States, who
            emit

            And yet, despite the outsized role the United States plays in
            perpetuating the climate crisis, it’s important not to close our
            eyes to the deep disparities in experiences of climate change that
            exist even within the wealthier countries where it’s produced.
            Although U.S. residents are the global leaders in carbon use,
            members of the wealthiest 1% in the United States use

            uneven pattern of impacts within cities, where communities of color

            left relatively unscathed.

          <h3>Climate debt in default</h3>
          <p>
            Though, crucially, the ’92 Earth Summit in Rio failed to set clear,
            enforceable goals for the reduction of carbon emissions, 154
            governments did ratify the United Nations Framework Convention on
            Climate Change (UNFCCC), which created a formal international
            process for negotiating coordinated global action in response to the
            climate crisis. (Forty more countries have since signed on.) Since
            then, climate justice activists and governments of the world’s least
            developed countries have been elaborating the concept of climate
            debt and pushing the cause for repayment at major UNFCCC
            conferences. Results have often been slow in coming. Tellingly,
            despite the intense ongoing UNFCCC negotiations held since ’92, the
            amount of carbon pumped into the atmosphere annually has nearly
            doubled.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 2009’s Copenhagen summit once again failed to produce
            meaningful, legally binding commitments from industrialized nations
            for compensation and emissions reductions, over thirty thousand
            grassroots activists from 140 countries came together in Cochabamba,
            Bolivia to consolidate their demands. Organized around principles of
            participatory democracy, the 2010 World People’s Conference on
            Climate Change produced a detailed People’s Accord, which outlined a
            legal framework for how the North can be held accountable for their

            calls on the North to “decolonize the atmosphere” by reducing and
            absorbing their emissions; to guarantee the human rights of the
            hundreds of millions forced to migrate by eliminating restrictive
            immigration policies; to monetarily compensate the South for the
            “loss of development opportunities due to living in a restricted
            atmospheric space”; to pay the costs of mitigation and adaptation;
            and to finance and share clean technologies. Bolivia submitted a
            proposal to the UNFCCC based on the Cochabamba accords shortly
            thereafter.

            But they’re up against an array of powerful interests. Governments
            of wealthy nations—particularly the United States—have obstructed
            climate justice proposals at virtually every turn. With a little
            digging, behind these government officials’ and diplomats’
            intransigence, you can usually find the influence of a sophisticated
            network of ultra-rich individuals who benefit from the climate
            crisis through crisscrossing networks of trade, finance, and
            carbon-rich industry. An eye-opening 2011 report from the
            International Forum on Globalization maps how these “carbon
            billionaires” use their personal wealth to exert a tremendous amount
            of influence, playing governments off of each other and holding
            climate negotiations hostage to ensure they can

          <h2 class="submenu">Beyond Growth and Debt</h2>
          <p>
            Within our current nation-state-based global political framework,
            calculating climate debts by country may be the most practical way
            to account for the history of Northern-imposed capitalist industrial
            development and the disparities in wealth and mass destruction it
            continues to cause. Those of us who live in wealthy nations, to the
            extent that we engage with or agitate against the governments that
            claim to represent us, must demand that reparations are made for the
            environmental damage caused by over two hundred years of intense
            exploitation of the earth’s natural resources at the expense of the
            world’s poorest.
          </p>
          <p>
            But in the same way that calculations of monetary loans simplify
            complicated relationships, calculating climate debt by
            nation-states’ emissions can obscure important exploitative power
            dynamics that exist at every level in a globalized neoliberal
            economy. Ultimately, beyond the billionaires and intransigent
            governments that perpetuate climate change lies the compelling force
            of the global capitalist economy itself, the very existence of which
            hinges on the ability to burn and emit carbon without acknowledging
            the costs. Its logic is integrated into our very way of life. As
            such, paying back the climate debt owed must be seen as just the
            first step towards setting aside our collective obsession with
            growth.

            This is the fundamental challenge of climate change. If we’re going
            to avert complete destruction of the environment, what’s really
            needed is a radical shift in the values that guide us, along with a
            transformation of the way we organize our lives and our communities.
            A global economic system that relies on never-ending economic growth
            inevitably means more carbon emissions and greater climate change.
            To those of us who’ve lived our entire lives in such a world, it’s
            difficult to know how to begin imagining new ways of living together
            prosperously, with respect for each other and our shared climate.
            There are no simple answers.

            But traditional cultures that have been resisting the imposition of
            Western-style economic development for decades may be able to
            provide some clues in the search for alternatives. In Andean regions
            of Latin America for example, over decades of common struggle
            against the destructive effects of development projects, a rich
            discourse around concepts of
            <a
              title="“Buen Vivir: Today’s Tomorrow”"
              href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMGudynas"
              target="_blank"
              ><i>vivir bien</i></a
            >
            has emerged among diverse communities of indigenous people, peasant
            groups, and the urban poor. Though a simple translation of the
            Spanish words “vivir bien” would be something like “to live well,”
            the term refers to a confluence of rich political and philosophical
            concepts of “harmonious living” emerging from Aymara, Quechua,
            Kichwa, Guarani, and other regional traditions.<a
              title=""
              href="#_ftn21"
              ><br />
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            As these traditions largely lack notions of linear progress, their
            concepts don’t lend themselves to simple translation but provide
            valuable counterpoints to Western worldviews. Though different
            cultures emphasize different aspects, concepts of
            <em>vivir bien</em> generally address issues Westerners might group
            under the term “quality of life,” but with the understanding that
            true well-being can only occur in a community. Importantly, nature
            is considered to be part of the community rather than simply a
            setting or a resource to be exploited. Though concepts of
            <em>vivir bien</em> have been enshrined in the constitutions of both
            Bolivia and Ecuador, it doesn’t represent a fixed set of principles.
            It continues to evolve in response to technocratic, commodifying,
            growth-focused development ideologies, yet draws in other facets of
            Western thought when useful as well. As Western cultures begin to
            imagine what life after the past two hundred years of carbon-fueled
            growth might look like, we might do well to draw in aspects of
            <em>vivir bien</em> in return.
