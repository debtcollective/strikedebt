            <li>[Creditor]</li>
            <li>[Account number]</li>

          <p>To whom it may concern:</p>
          <p>
            In reviewing my credit report, I realized there are several
            inaccurate listings. These accounts are incorrect and several are
            outdated. The following accounts need to be investigated immediately
            to reflect my true credit history:
          </p>
          <p>Acct: [-xxxx-xxx:]</p>
          <p>
            This account is listed as being 60 days late. I have never been late
            on this account.
          </p>
          <p>Acct: [-xxxx-xxx:]</p>
          <p>
            This account is listed as being 30 days late. This account does not
            belong to me.
          </p>
          <p>Acct: [-xxxx-xxx:]</p>
          <p>
            This account is listed as being 60 days late. The creditor lost my
            check and agreed to correct the late notation. (Enclosed is a copy
            of their letter stating such).
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, you are reporting several other accounts as delinquent
            that are past the seven-year reporting time as allowed under the
            Fair Credit Reporting Act. The following accounts should be deleted
            immediately:
          </p>
          <p>Acct: [-xxx:] over seven years old</p>
          <p>Acct: [-xxx:] over eight years old</p>
          <p>Acct: [-xxx:] over seven years and four months old</p>
          <p>
            Please forward an updated copy to me at your earliest convenience
            with the above noted corrections. My current address is listed
            above.
          </p>

          <h3>3. “Intent to Sue” Letter to Credit Bureau</h3>
          <p>
            <i
              >Send this letter to the CRA if you intend on suing them. You can
              sue them in your county for damages and subsequently send a copy
              of that to them, offering to settle or appear. If you sue them, be
              sure you have a case.</i

          <p>[Date]</p>
          <p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
          <p>REF: Intent to file suit: violation of the FCRA</p>
          <p>
            I have sent [#] previous letters to you, all by certified mail
            (copies of receipts enclosed) requesting that you remove inaccurate
            information from my file and you have failed to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accordingly, I can show a judge that these accounts are inaccurate
            and that you violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by ignoring my
            requests to investigate the items. My previous letters—all sent
            certified mail—stated my reasons for an investigation and these
            reasons were not frivolous in any way.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this final request does not prompt you to conduct a proper
            investigation of the accounts in question, and send proof to me of
            said investigation, I will file a civil suit in [name of your
            county, state] for damages. I take my credit very seriously and your
            lack of professionalism and assistance is unacceptable. I am well
            aware of my rights under the FCRA and intend to pursue them to the
            maximum.
          </p>
          <p>I anticipate your response.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

              investigate items you have initiated a dispute on. Often a CRA
              will accuse you of using a credit repair company, which by the way
              is your right! Here is a letter to put them in their place and to
              avoid slowing your disputes.</i

          <p>RE: Credit Repair Accusation</p>
          <p>
            Please be advised that I have received your computer generated
            letter stating that you have ceased investigation of my credit
            reports because, in your opinion, you believe that I have used a
            third party credit repair agency. Not only do I believe this to be a
            stall tactic on your part to grant you an additional 30 days to
            comply with my original request, but I believe it to be a blatant
            violation of the FCRA.
          </p>
          <p>
            You were advised by me on [insert date] by certified mail (copy
            enclosed) that I questioned the accuracy of a few items on my credit
            reports. That request was written by me and mailed by me—not a third
            party agency. It appears obvious to me that you are abusing your
            power under the FCRA to escape a complete investigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally there is no law that states a consumer cannot use a
            third party, so using that as your excuse is a moot point. As a
            matter of fact, Congress has found the whole process so overwhelming
            that they afford consumers the right to use a third party on their
            behalf if the consumer so chooses. This is why your statement is so
            outrageous.
          </p>
          <p>
            I reserve the right to sue your credit bureau for violations of the
            FCRA and I believe I can prove that you did not use reasonable
            measures to insure the accuracy of my credit reports and now you are
            stalling the process further.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please take notice that this letter dated [insert today’s date] is
            formal notice to you that I am requesting that you continue forward
            with my original investigation request and send the results to me
            within 15 days. I therefore legally and lawfully refuse your “form
            letter,” thus giving you only 15 days, not 30 more.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am outraged at your accusation and I have fully researched my
            rights in regards to my credit file. I look forward to your
            expediting my original request immediately.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
