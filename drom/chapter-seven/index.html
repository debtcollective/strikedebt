          Fringe Finance Transaction Products and Services: Making Bank on the

            As James Baldwin once said, “Anyone who has ever struggled with
            poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.” This is
            true now more than ever. Some call it the “poverty tax”—the
            surcharge people pay for not having savings or access to “prime”
            credit and being consigned to “fringe finance.” Fringe finance
            refers to the array of “alternative” financial services (AFS)
            offered by providers that operate outside of federally insured
            banks. Gary Rivlin, author of<i>
              Broke USA: From Pawnshops to Poverty, Inc.</i
            >, does the math; adding up the profits from the AFS sector and
            dividing by the forty million households that survive on $30,000 a
            year or less, the industry receives an average of $2,500 per year
            from every low-income household. That’s a “poverty tax” of around
            10%, depleting the assets of low-income households. This chapter and
            the next chapter break down the major perils of fringe finance into
            those related to transactions and those related to credit. This
            chapter deals with transaction products and services: check cashing
            and prepaid cards.

            covers credit products and services: payday loans, auto-title and
            pawn loans, and rent-to-own financing. Among households without
            access to a bank account, 62% have used an AFS transaction product
            or service and 27% have used an AFS credit product or service. About

              >23% have used both</a
            >. Both chapters offer analysis and information to help you identify
            the common tricks and traps of fringe finance so that you can avoid
            them. We consider alternatives to the most expensive products and
            services, as well as how to save money if you’re “locked in” or have
            no other options. There is no one-size-fits-all strategy for
            personal finance. We conclude
            <a
              title="Chapter Eight. Fringe Finance Credit Products and Services: Credit for the Precariat"

            by outlining some individual and collective strategies that aim to
            minimize or eliminate our dependence on the current debt-finance
            system. Investors, however, expect the stunning rates of financial
            extraction in the poverty industry to rise, and it has created funds
            to invest in startups and small firms with big growth potential in
            the fringe finance sector. The “market” that investors want to tap
            is the unbanked (people without checking or savings accounts) and
            the underbanked (people who rely on a combination of both
            “traditional” and “alternative” financial products). Why are
            investors so interested in this market? Not only is it a market that
            has previously been off their radar, it is a market that promises
            greater returns—even after adjusting for increased risk (otherwise,
            they wouldn’t be interested). In a blog post titled “Not Unbanked:
            Untapped,” a venture fund manager explains, “It is fair to say that
            most of these products are

              >generally more expensive</a

            than what most of ‘us’ pay. APRs [annual percentage rates of
            interest] higher than 30% (if not 300%); transaction costs of $2+;
            money-transfer costs of $10+; access to payroll check for 2–4%.” The
            transaction services segment of AFS has seen some of the most
            spectacular growth in recent years, where prepaid cards are making
            inroads and recording profits that rival the always-profitable
            check-cashing outlets (CCOs). This is the predicament of the poor in
            our debt-finance system: it costs poor people significantly more
            <i>to use money</i>—to spend it, to save it, to invest it, to borrow
            it, to send it “back home” (for immigrants whose families still live
            in their country of origin)—and they have less money to begin with.
            If you’re poor, you are likely forced to engage with the
            debt-finance system, and the more wealth it takes from you, the more
            indebted you become. Meanwhile, AFS owners and investors, who enjoy
            lower financing costs than you and have more money to begin with,
            profit from your loss and acquire pieces of your debt. Thus,
            investors on Wall Street come to own pieces of your future. These
            are the workings of a two-tiered financial system, on the bottom of
            which are relatively high-cost services marketed to the growing and
            changing ranks of the unbanked and the underbanked. The nearly ten
            million unbanked includes the working poor, the unemployed, the
            homeless, the undocumented, those who do not speak English fluently,
            those who are or have been incarcerated, those with mental or
            physical health issues, older people, those working off the books,
            those hiding from creditors or the “authorities,” those whose homes
            were stolen by robo-signing investment banks, youth who have been
            cut off from their parents, and anyone else who “traditional”
            financial institutions deem unworthy of service. Demographically
            speaking, the unbanked population is broad and diverse, but it is

            of low-income households (71% of unbanked households earn below
            $30,000 a year), households of color, immigrant households, and
            individuals with negative banking histories. (Of course, many of the
            unbanked fit into multiple categories.) In general, Latino/a and
            Black people are six and seven times more likely to be unbanked than
            Whites respectively. Households with an annual income under $30,000
            are

            >
            than those with an income between $50,000 and $75,000. More than
            half of immigrants in New York City are unbanked, according to a
            recent survey. People of color and immigrants are more likely to
            have low, unreliable, or seasonal income, making it more difficult
            to save enough money to meet minimum opening-balance requirements at
            banks.

            is the number one reason that the unbanked do not have a bank
            account. There’s another significant commonality: many people of

            for no reason but the color of one’s skin—especially in a society
            focused on wealth accumulation—is traumatic<i>.</i> The effects can
            ripple across generations of a family, shaping how future
            generations interact with financial institutions. Banks have
            historically been places reserved for middle- or upper-class White
            men, and that explicitly exclusionary past makes its impact felt in
            today’s world in various less overt ways. Because of the openly
            racist and classist history of U.S. credit practices, banks can feel

            by many banks to open accounts, and furthermore fear that banks will
            share their immigration status with the authorities. Some of the
            unbanked and underbanked rely on fringe finance because it helps
            them avoid unnecessary difficulties posed by mainstream financial
            products—difficulties which reflect their socially marginalized
            status. If you are a transgender person applying for a bank account,
            for example, you must use your legal name and gender, even if it is
            different from the name and gender that you identify as (though in
            Washington State, at least, transgender people have the right to be
            referred to by their name and gender when doing business at a bank).
            Preloaded debit cards, which do not have the owner’s name printed on
            them, help trans people avoid harassment caused by a mismatch
            between the printed name and their gender presentation. (This
            information was obtained in a private email correspondence with the
            founder of a trans activist group in the Pacific Northwest. They
            relayed various members’ experiences with banking and using fringe
            finance.) It can become difficult for unbanked people to document
            and prove income when filing for benefits, workers&#8217;
            compensation, or filing cases against abusive employers. For many of
            the unbanked, the experience of second-tier status in the financial
            system mirrors their experience with the two-tiered justice system.
            Those who are socially marginalized in one way or another are more
            likely to occupy the bottom tier of the financial system, which
            makes it more likely they’ll get caught up in the criminal justice
            system. The criminalization of poverty, the criminalization of
            immigration, as well as racial and ethnic profiling are
            well-documented trends that push people to the fringes of finance.
            And being on the fringes of finance is itself increasingly
            criminalized. In

            in the United States, cashing paychecks at a bank or credit union is

            any number of the reasons discussed earlier. For many people, a CCO

            free. If you’re unbanked and you make $500 every week, in one year
            you might spend $400 if you’re relatively lucky, but possibly over
            $1,000, just so you can spend your own money. The average unbanked
            person with a full-time job can expect to spend more than $40,000 on

            as CCOs may be, and as much as they target people with lower
            incomes, if they all pulled up stakes and left, what would happen?
            Several alternatives may be available. You could make an arrangement
            with a trusted friend, family member, or even your employer—that is,
            someone with access to a checking account—in which you would write
            your check over to them and they would give you the full amount in
            cash. You could join with others in your community and approach a
            local community center or religious institution to ask if they would
            be willing to set up a free check-cashing service. You could talk to
            local credit unions about their free checking accounts and, to
            encourage the credit union to offer the services you need, organize
            others to join in your request. Your collective power and voice
            could open up new possibilities. If you have exhausted other options

          <aside>
            Among the unbanked are many undocumented immigrants who believe that
            without a social security card they are unable to open up an
            account. The law does not require banks to ask you to provide a
            Social Security number to open an account, nor does it require them
            to inquire about your immigration status. The law simply requires
            that banks ask for your name, date of birth, street address, and one
            of several different kinds of identification numbers. While most
            banks have stricter policies, an increasing number of banks and
            credit unions who see opportunity in a growing immigrant population

            in the place of an SSN. Also, many consulates will provide their
            citizens with foreign ID cards that banks and credit unions are
            increasingly accepting. The most popular of these is the Mexican
            <i>matricula consular</i>. The Mexican consulate provides a list of
            banks and credit unions that accept this either as primary or
            secondary ID.

            In addition to exorbitant check-cashing fees, there are fees for
            money transfers. Nearly two-thirds of immigrants in New York City,
            according to a recent survey, reported using remittance services to
            send money back to their families in their country of origin, 60% of
            whom send money every month. Most remittances go simply to pay for
            basic household needs, such as rent, utilities, and buying food.

            aimed at stopping sudden and unexpected penalties, there’s really
            nothing that limits the overall fee. By contrast, banks and credit
            unions charge substantially less for this and other services. Some
            banks even offer special low-cost money transfers to certain
            countries. Services that could cost up to $500 annually at a CCO

            increasingly many banks, have flexible ID requirements, making it
            simpler for immigrants to open accounts. Be sure to find out if they
            require a minimum balance to maintain an account and if they require
            the recipient to have a bank account. If you must use a money
            transfer service, be sure to ask what the exchange rate is and how
            much will actually be given to the recipient. Find out if the
            recipient will be charged any fees when picking up the money.
            Remember, you have the right to transfer money in U.S. dollars
            unless the receiving country has a law requiring money to be

          <p>
            First there were credit cards. Then came debit cards. Now there are
            prepaid cards—and they’re suddenly everywhere. Think about it this
            way: with credit cards you pay later, with debit cards you pay now,
            and with prepaid cards you pay early. Credit cards extend credit to
            consumers for free (with a grace period and assuming good credit).
            Debit cards give consumers free access to funds in their bank
            accounts. Prepaid cards charge consumers to access their own funds.
            So when you use a prepaid card you are essentially paying<i
            > </i>money to make an interest-free <i>loan</i> to the issuer, who
            then lends your money to other customers. Charging us for the use of
            our own money is what banks do. They also provide useful services:
            the ability to store our money, to access cash, to pay for things
            without cash, and to turn checks into cash. Prepaid cards—now used

              >13% of people in the United States</a
            >—do the same, although they’re not attached to bank accounts. (Some
            banks have gotten into the prepaid card game—e.g., Chase Liquid,
            Bank of America CashPay, PNC <i>Smart</i>Access—but even their cards
            are not attached to accounts.) Branded with the logos of American
            Express, Discover, MasterCard, or Visa, they look like other plastic
            payment cards and provide ATM access and the ability to make
            purchases. There are a variety of prepaid cards, including gift
            cards, payroll cards, government benefits cards, and “general
            purpose reloadable” (GPR) cards, which let you add funds. Prepaid
            cards are usually more costly, less convenient, and less secure than
            comparable services from banks, and they tend to have poor
            disclosure policies and “gotcha” fees, replicating some of the most
            aggravating bank practices. Nonetheless, compared with a
            check-cashing outlet, getting cash from a prepaid card is usually
            cheaper. When it comes to making payments, prepaid cards are
            typically more expensive than credit or debit cards, but not
            necessarily. If you factor in overdraft charges, debit cards can
            cost more. If you factor in high ongoing balances, high interest
            rates, and late payment penalties, credit cards may cost
            considerably more than prepaid cards. Hence, there is no
            one-size-fits-all strategy for personal financial transactions.
            What’s more, the rules governing the prepaid card industry are still
            in flux. In 2010 the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and
            Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) took effect,

            Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is presently considering how to
            bring the prepaid card market into the federal regulatory framework.
            In the meantime, barriers to cash continue to grow; transactions for

            universities begin to adopt them. Purchasable, usable, and sometimes

              >of the prison system</a
            >. There are also branded cards that are linked to celebrities,
            heroes, and social causes, and tend to be the most predatory corner
            of the market. Many consumer advocates consider prepaid cards just
            the latest addition to the array of high-cost and inferior financial
            products for which the poor pay more. Not only do prepaid cards
            generally fail to serve their ostensible function of helping
            marginalized groups enter the financial mainstream, they also tend
            to intensify financial segregation. The predicament of Millennials,
            who appear to be the industry’s latest target, is especially
            alarming. Not long after the CARD Act restricted credit card
            companies’ access to college campuses and to customers under
            twenty-one, prepaid cards began moving in, looking to establish
            “partnerships.” Now with prepaid cards increasingly serving as
            student IDs, enrolling in college also means enrolling in a bank.

          <h3>General purpose reloadable (GPR) cards</h3>
          <p>
            GPR cards are the kind that you buy and set up yourself, like a gift
            card with fees. They range from competitively priced, no-frills
            cards to premium-priced celebrity cards, which are marketed as
            symbols of achievement or aspiration as often as they are advertised
            as financial tools. Beyond utility, the latter promise respect,
            empowerment and freedom. Of course, prepaid cards are not unique in
            this sense: everything we consume says something about who we are
            and what we believe. The problem with most celebrity cards is not
            simply that they don’t deliver what’s promised, but that they’re
            designed to deliver exactly the opposite of what’s promised,
            resulting in financial marginalization<i>.</i> These cards can
            quickly extract money from their users. Consumers Union found
            <a
              title="“Consumers Union Report: Prepaid Cards Come with Long List of Fees and Weak Consumer Protections”"
              href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMMcCauley2"
              target="_blank"
              >many different types of fees</a
            >
            for a range of prepaid cards. In addition to monthly fees, they
            found fees for activation, point-of-sale transaction, cash
            withdrawal, balance inquiry, transaction statements, customer
            service, bill payment, adding funds, dormancy, account closure, and
            overdraft. Making matters worse, only a few of the fees charged by
            card issuers are disclosed prior to signing up for the card. Retail
            displays often contain only purchase prices and initial load
            amounts, and card company websites frequently require users to click
            on sign-up pages or registration forms in order to obtain fee
            information. Consumer Action surveyed twenty-eight different prepaid
            cards and found that twenty of them carry a monthly maintenance fee,
            the highest being $14.95. Fees for out-of-network ATM withdrawals
            range from $1.95 to $3. A few cards charge users to reload money.
            Ten of the cards surveyed charge 50 cents to $2 to talk to a
            customer service agent and two of them charge 50 cents for automated
            help. Like the worst practices in subprime mortgage lending, private
            student loans, and payday lending, the marketing and sales
            strategies of the celebrity prepaid card business are
            <i>predatory</i>; the best predators have a deep appreciation for
            the needs of their prey. “Well-banked” celebrities like Russell
            Simmons and Suze Orman are marketers of prepaid cards that target
            financially marginalized people. While their marketing suggests they
            are running charities, Simmons and Orman are managing private
            companies whose unequivocal objective is to profit from providing
            financial services to poor people. They deceptively present their
            enterprises as altruistic projects striving for collective
            emancipation (e.g.,
            <a
              title="The Approved Prepaid Mastercard"

              target="_blank"
              >theapprovedcard.com</a
            >). Yes, this is how capitalism works.

          <h3>Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards and payroll cards</h3>
          <p>
            Over the past 15 years, the federal government and state governments
            have been gradually replacing paper benefits checks with Electronic
            Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards. For the unbanked, the shift to
            electronic payments means no check-cashing fees, less need to carry
            cash, faster payments, the ability to make purchases or pay bills
            electronically, and no ChexSystems screen (see<a
              title="Chapter One. Credit Scores and Consumer Reporting Agencies: Surveillance and the Vicious Cycle of Debt"
              href="/drom/chapter-one/"
              target="_blank"
              ><i> Chapter One </i></a
            >for information about ChexSystems). But overall, costs and benefits
            will vary depending on the fees and terms that apply to the
            particular prepaid card designated for your benefits program. These
            are administered by different federal and state government agencies,
            which contract with various prepaid card issuers. California and New
            Jersey are considered to have negotiated relatively good contracts
            for their unemployed workers, providing
            <a
              title='"Unemployment Compensation Prepaid Cards: States Can Deal Workers a Winning Hand by Discarding Junk Fees"'
              href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMSaunders"
              target="_blank"
              >free and ample access to cash and transaction information with no
              penalty fees</a
            >. Tennessee workers, on the other hand, get slammed with the
            highest junk fees courtesy of JPMorgan Chase, the bank contracted to
            service that state’s unemployment compensation (UC) prepaid card
            program. For recipients of Social Security, Supplemental Security
            Income (SSI), or Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation, the Direct
            Express prepaid debit card has much lower fees than other prepaid
            cards and comes with strong consumer protections. Card accounts are
            insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) and are
            subject to federal consumer protection regulations (i.e.,
            <a
              title="Electronic Funds Transfer (Regulation E)"
              href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMCFPB2"
              target="_blank"
              >Regulation E</a
            >). The prepaid card programs administered by the states to disburse
            UC, as well as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and
            food stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), are more
            problematic. They’re generally less beneficial for recipients and
            more beneficial for banks and states. Forty states now use a prepaid
            card for paying some or all UC recipients. A survey by the National
            Consumer Law Center found significant shortcomings in fee
            structures, access to card information and payment options. Across
            the board, fees charged to benefit recipients are being used to
            cover the administrative costs of delivering UC benefits—in
            violation of federal law. Cards may charge

              href="http://tinyurl.com/DROMSaunders"
              target="_blank"
              >ATM balance inquiry fees, denied transaction fees, $10 to $20
              overdraft fees, and inactivity fees</a
            >. On top of this, card issuers such as Bank of America, Citibank,
            and JPMorgan Chase earn interchange fees—fees paid from one bank to
            another when accepting a transaction—as well as interest on the
            funds on deposit. Last year, card fees and ATM surcharges cost
            California welfare recipients

              title="“Governments Adopt Prepaid Cards for Benefits”"

              >over $17 million</a
            >. The bottom line: for those who have a bank account, prepaid cards
            offer little, if any, advantage over direct deposit. Benefit
            recipients with checking accounts will save money and time with
            direct deposit. Those who do not have that option—who lack access to
            a bank account or who live in one of the six states that have
            eliminated the direct deposit option—will be forced into the prepaid
            payroll card program(s) contracted to disburse your particular
            benefit(s). Since you have no choice about which card to use,
            familiarize yourself with the terms and fees that apply to the card
            designated for your program. This information should arrive in paper
            form with your EBT card. You can also look up the details of the
            particular prepaid payroll program online.

          <h3>Survival strategies and resources</h3>
          <p>
            At a time when it’s hard to use your own cash (if you’re lucky
            enough to have any), prepaid cards can offer cash-like features such
            as anonymity, liquidity, and mobility. They’ll also save you money
            compared with high-cost check cashing. Prepaid cards have also been
            sold as a way to reduce our reliance on the big banks. But Suze
            Orman probably came closer to the truth when she said her card is
            like having a bank in your pocket. Regardless of whose face is on
            the card, you can be sure somebody on Wall Street is getting their
            cut. If you ultimately decide to get a prepaid card, you can visit
            <a title="Nerd Wallet" href="http://nerdwallet.com/" target="_blank"
              >nerdwallet.com</a
            >
            to determine which is the least costly. Avoid cards with the most
            unnecessary fees and be aware of which fees are associated with the
            card you end up choosing. Be on the lookout for reloading fees,
            balance inquiry fees, and ATM cash withdrawal fees. When buying gas
            with a prepaid card, pay the attendant inside before you pump,
            otherwise the station may put up to a $75 hold on your balance for a
            few days. It is also important to read the card’s privacy policy to
            make sure they aren’t
