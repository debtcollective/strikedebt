            The Rolling Jubilee is project of Strike Debt where we buy debts for
            pennies on the dollar. But instead of collecting on that debt like a
            debt collector would, we just abolish it. A common criticism of
            <a href="http://rollingjubilee.org/">Rolling Jubilee</a> is that
            we’re buying “bad” debts that would never have been collected
            anyway.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">We assure you that this is not the case.  Here’s why.</p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            We are stepping in to the process at precisely the same point as
            other participants, the debt buyers and debt collectors.  These are
            investors, who buy this debt precisely so that they can collect on
            it and make a profit.  And they are succeeding.
            <a href="http://nedap.org/">The New Economy Project</a> looked at
            just 26 debt buyers in just New York City over a two year period and
            documented how
            <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/DEBT_DECEPTION_FINAL_WEB.pdf"
              >they extracted $1.1 billion dollars of wealth from the poorest

          </h4>
          <h4 dir="ltr">If they’re valuable, why sell them?</h4>
          <p dir="ltr">
            If it’s possible to collect on these debts, why do the lenders sell
            them in the first place?  It turns out that large lenders like banks
            and credit card companies are actually required by law to write off
            the value of all “non-performing” debts after a certain number of
            days, in order to keep the lenders from hiding large losses on their
            paper balance sheets.  These laws were mainly implemented
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_buyer"
              >after the Savings and Loan crisis</a
            >
            of the late 1980s, when bank books were bloated with badly accounted
            non-performing assets.  The number of days at which a debt is
            considered “non-performing”  vary by the type of debt and state, but
            can range from about 180 days to as little as 60 days!
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            When they write off the debts, the lenders get a tax deduction for
            the written-off value.  Many lenders choose to then sell these
            written-off debts, in bulk, to debt buyers.  Because they are
            already written off, and because they sell them in bulk, on a
            regular basis, the prices debt buyers pay are very low &#8211; often
            just pennies on the dollar.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            [This is also why buying debt is not, as some have claimed,
            &#8220;helping&#8221; the banks and lenders. If the Rolling Jubilee
            could buy enough debt to drive up the market price of debt &#8211;
            and we can&#8217;t, because the market, at around $100 billion per
            year, is far, far larger than we will ever be &#8211; we would not
            be enticing banks to sell more debt than they already are, because
            they are forced to sell it by law. But even in that unthinkable
            scenario, the primary effect of driving up the price of debt would
            be to increase the cost of doing business for debt collectors
            &#8211; potentially putting some of them out of business! We think
            that would be a fantastic outcome.]
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Sometimes, the banks selling the debt are providing financing to the
            debt buyers they are selling the debt to, so they end up making
            money off these collections, too!
          </p>

          <h4 dir="ltr">Debt buying is extremely profitable</h4>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Debt buying has been considered a &#8220;growth industry&#8221; for
            much of the past decade precisely because these debts are highly
            collectable. Collectors will buy a large portfolio and then start
            &#8220;working&#8221; the debt for 2-5 months. They don&#8217;t need
            to collect on every single account in order to make a massive profit
            because they bought this debt at such a steep discount. And they
            don&#8217;t need to collect 100% of each account. One common
            practice is to offer to settle with debtors for 50% of the original
            principal. The debtors are tricked into thinking this is such a
            great deal, and even feel an extra obligation to pay because they
            think this is an act of generosity on the part of the debt
            collector. But if someone pays 50% of a debt’s face value when the
            investor purchased it for just 3%, the investor is still making a
            return on investment of 1,666%!
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            A debt buyer will generally have a particular profit margin that
            they are trying to hit and will keep working a portfolio until they
            hit it. At that point they will sell the remain accounts downstream.
            The next investor will wait a year or so and then try again.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Debt buyers make their most money off of people who are just getting
            back on their feet. The debt industry makes its most money by
            preying on people who are temporarily down on their luck,
            can&#8217;t pay their bills for a short period of time, and get
            loaded up with debt.  Collectors tend to make their largest profits
            about a year or two after the debt was considered “non-performing”,
            when the debtor’s situation has improved.
            <a href="http://rollingjubilee.org/transparency"
              >Most of the debts we buy fall in this most lucrative time
              window</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h4 dir="ltr">A bailout for those who need it most</h4>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Fundamentally, our project of abolishing this debt is keeping more
            money in the hands of debtors who need more money, and it is
            removing millions of dollars that would have ended up in the hands
            of investors and collectors.  To be sure, the Rolling Jubilee is a
            drop in the bucket in terms of overall indebtedness, or even debt
            being traded in the secondary market, but for the people who are
            helped,

            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we look beyond the Rolling Jubilee, we are developing tactics to
            help build collective forms of power that will allow us all to
            resist illegitimate debts. Throughout history, when debtors have
            banded together, they have won. We are building tools and organizing
            to help break our collective bonds. The Rolling Jubilee is a spark,
            not the solution. In the meantime, here are some
            <a href="/act/">ways you can keep the Jubilee rolling</a>.
