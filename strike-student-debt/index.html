            Once again, Congress is talking about how to fix student debt
            without actually talking about student debt or the cost of higher
            education. To date, the negotiations have been focused on where to
            set the interest rate charged to students. It currently stands at
            3.4% but is set to double on July first to 6.8%. This is like
            arguing about how to save a person drowning in a lake by quibbling
            over how deep the water should be: 100 feet, or 200 feet? In May,
            Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed a bill to cut the rate to
            0.75%—the same amount that the Federal Reserve charges to banks. She
            has recently called for a grassroots movement to back her bill,
            recognizing the futility of trying to get it through a Congress
            hungry for campaign dollars from the likes of Sallie Mae. [<a

            While we are of course deeply in favor of building a movement around
            the debt crisis, we think that any such movement must target the
            root of the problem, rather than pruning the foliage. In a truly
            democratic society, nobody would have to go into debt to earn a
            diploma. Education should be empowering, but debt-financed education
            serves only to ossify inequalities. Higher education should be
            available to all, regardless of ability to pay. Public two- and
            four-year colleges should be free, funded as a public good, and all
            current student debt should be erased.

            work, it helps to understand that the major reason tuition has
            nearly sextupled since 1985 [<a
              href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/why-tuition-has-skyrocketed-at-state-schools/"
              >Rampell 2012</a

              >Delta Cost Project, 2010</a
            >] When states stop investing, college administrators must turn to
            Wall Street. This leads them to think like CEOs. They slash course
            offerings that cannot squeeze past their one-dimensional
            cost-benefit analyses. They eliminate full-time faculty positions
            and hire more low-paid, part-time instructors who can’t provide the
            individual attention and mentoring that is particularly important
            for lower- and middle-income students. [On average, almost three
            quarters of all college teachers nationwide are adjuncts.] They know
            that phasing out tenure in favor of means-testing has the added
            advantage of removing a powerful source of accountability for
            administrators’ actions.

            In order to make up for financial shortfalls, colleges have
            increasingly turned to issuing bonds, using tuition as collateral to
            secure loans from Wall Street. For example, in 2012, the University
            of California sold almost a billion dollars in bonds set to mature
            over the next 100 years. That means UC students’ tuition dollars
            will be used to line the pockets of big investors over the next ten
            decades. To ensure a steady flow of riches, financiers hold colleges
            hostage by threatening to ruin their credit ratings if tuition does
            not go up [<a
              href="http://articles.philly.com/2013-06-02/news/39676676_1_barchi-rutgers-president-robert-l-mike-rice"
              >Mondics 2013</a
            >]. When students can’t find the money, they must take on more debt
            to pay ever-rising tuition bills. The profit-mongers on Wall Street
            are happy to oblige. They bundle up the debt into asset-backed
            securities to be sold to global investors. 85% of securitized
            student loans are financed on the global market. [<a
              href="https://www.bostonreview.net/us/pomp-and-exceptional-circumstance"
              >Harris 2012</a
            >] Because the federal government prohibits discharging student debt
            via bankruptcy in all but the most extreme situations (and until
            recently guaranteed repayment via the Federal Family Education Loan
            Program), the 1% is once again guaranteed gangbuster profits.

            families carry student debt, but almost forty percent of young
            families do. There is more than $1 trillion in outstanding student
            debt (more than any other type of non-housing debt
            <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/householdcredit/index.html"
              >[New York Fed 2013]</a

            individual bearers&#8211;by limiting career choices, straining
            relationships, and wearing away at mental health [<a

            monies and energies into debt repayment rather than, well, almost
            anything else.  (For a particularly egregious example, doctors in
            delinquency on their medical school debt are prohibited from
            treating patients most in need [<a

            With a situation so desperate, one might think that any help would
            be welcome. But what good does it do to lower interest rates without
            addressing the rising cost of college? (Indeed, lowered interest
            rates might force tuition to grow even more quickly to make up for
            financiers’ lost profits.) The current debate taking place in
            Congress is a distraction at best and delusional at worst.

            The $1 trillion of student debt is a shackle on the futures of
            millions of students, especially students who are otherwise
            disempowered. Student debtors are less likely to start families,
            choose public service careers, or be able to build their lives in
            ways that include more than just following a plan to repay loans [<a

            Many young people today are unaware that college was free or
            virtually free in the United States for much of the 20th century, as
            it still is in many countries around the world. Publicly financed
            higher education is the only way to return sanity to the system and
            reclaim our democracy. Moreover, publicly financed colleges and
            universities are eminently affordable.  For the money spent on the
            ten years of the Iraq War so far, we could provide completely free
            public higher education at every single two and four year school in
            the country &#8211; for the next 58 years [<a

            Setting aside the question of whether private colleges are desirable
            at all, of course. Taking banks and profit out of the equation will
            go a long way towards ending the debt spiral.  The federal
            government should provide zero-interest loans to students who choose
            to attend accredited, tax-exempt private institutions. It should
            also be illegal for colleges and financial institutions to sell
            student debt as derivatives.  Securitizing student loans obfuscates
            the true risk associated with these loans [<a

              >Harris 2011</a
            >] and has already led to a bubble in the student loan market,
            echoing what we just witnessed in the realm of mortgage-backed
            securities and the housing market [<a
              href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-07/bankers-warn-fed-of-farm-student-loan-bubbles-echoing-subprime.html"
              >Zumbrun &amp; Torres 2013</a
            >]. Even better, getting rid of servicing fees and bank middlemen
            will dramatically reduce costs overall, and thus lower the price of
            attending college [<a

            If an educational institution wants to receive a federal tax
            exemption, it must provide a full accounting of its finances to the
            public, not the ersatz documents they get away with today. But
            transparency is nothing without democratic accountability: faculty
            governance must be strengthened (the revival of tenure as an
            institution would be a welcome start) and students must be brought
            into the decision-making process.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an alternative reality where Congress were not bought and paid
            for, this plan would be &#8220;centrist&#8221; and the Warren plan
            would be considered deeply conservative. Since we don’t live in that
            world, we believe that the only sensible thing to do is to resist
            student debt. It is immoral, illegitimate, odious, a drain on both
            those who must bear it and the society in which they live. We
            believe that a true grassroots movement of student debtors&#8211;the
            movement we want to be a part of&#8211;will organize a collective
            refusal to pay. When student debtors realize their collective power
            in this way, then we might suddenly find ourselves in a world where
            politicians are forced to treat education as a public good.
